Impact of Genetics on Medical Practice

The beginning of the new millennium was marked by the announcement that the vast majority of the human genome had been sequenced. This milestone in the exploration of the human genome was preceded by numerous conceptual and technologic advances. They include, among others, the elucidation of the DNA double-helix structure, the discovery of restriction enzymes and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the development and automatization of DNA sequencing, and the generation of genetic and physical maps by the Human Genome Project (HGP). The consequences of this wealth of knowledge for the practice of medicine are profound. First, the most significant impact of genetics has been to enhance our understanding of disease etiology and pathogenesis. However, genetics is playing an increasingly prominent role in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease (Chap. 63). Genetic approaches have proven invaluable for the detection of infectious pathogens and are used clinically to identify agents that are difficult to culture such as mycobacteria, viruses, and parasites. In many cases, molecular genetics has improved the feasibility and accuracy of diagnostic testing and is beginning to open new avenues for therapy, including gene and cellular therapy (Chaps. 68 and 67). Molecular genetics has significantly changed the treatment of human disease. Peptide hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and vaccines can now be produced in large amounts using recombinant DNA technology. Targeted modifications of these peptides provide the practitioner with improved therapeutic tools, as illustrated by genetically modified insulin analogues with more favorable kinetics. There is hope that a better understanding of the genetic basis of human disease will also have an increasing impact on disease prevention.

Genetics has traditionally been viewed through the window of relatively rare single-gene diseases. Taken together, these disorders account for 10% of pediatric admissions and childhood mortality. It is, however, increasingly apparent that virtually every medical condition has a genetic component. As is often evident from a patient's family history, many common disorders such as hypertension, heart disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, and mental illnesses are significantly influenced by the genetic background. These polygenic or multifactorial (complex) disorders involve the contributions of many different genes, as well as environmental factors that can modify disease risk (Chap. 63). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have elucidated numerous disease-associated loci and are providing novel insights into the allelic architecture of complex traits. These studies have been facilitated by the availability of comprehensive catalogues of human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes generated through the HapMap Project.

Cancer has a genetic basis since it results from acquired somatic mutations in genes controlling growth, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation (Chap. 83). In addition, the development of many cancers is associated with a hereditary predisposition. The prevalence of genetic diseases, combined with their severity and chronic nature, imposes great financial, social, and emotional burdens on society.

Genetics has historically focused predominantly on chromosomal and metabolic disorders, reflecting the long-standing availability of techniques to diagnose these conditions. For example, conditions such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or monosomy X (Turner's syndrome) can be diagnosed using cytogenetics (Chap. 62). Likewise, many metabolic disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria, familial hyper每cholesterolemia) are diagnosed using biochemical analyses. Recent advances in DNA diagnostics have extended the field of genetics to include virtually all medical specialties. In cardiology, for example, the molecular basis of inherited cardiomyopathies and ion channel defects that predispose to arrhythmias is being defined (Chaps. 233 and 238). In neurology, genetics has unmasked the pathophysiology of a startling number of neurodegenerative disorders (Chap. 366). Hematology has evolved dramatically, from its incipient genetic descriptions of hemoglobinopathies to the current understanding of the molecular basis of red cell membrane defects, clotting disorders, and thrombotic disorders (Chaps. 104 and 116).

New concepts derived from genetic studies can sometimes clarify the pathogenesis of disorders that were previously opaque. For example, although many different genetic defects can cause peripheral neuropathies, disruption of the normal folding of the myelin sheaths is frequently a common final pathway (Chap. 384). Several genetic causes of obesity appear to converge on a physiologic pathway that involves products of the proopiomelanocortin polypeptide and the MC4R receptor, thus identifying a key mechanism for appetite control (Chap. 77). A similar phenomenon is emerging for genetically distinct forms of Alzheimer's disease, several of which lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (Chap. 371). The identification of defective genes often leads to the detection of cellular pathways involved in key physiologic processes. Examples include identification of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; the Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, which encodes dystrophin; and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) gene, which is responsible for achondroplastic dwarfism. Similarly, transgenic (over)expression, and targeted gene "knock-out" and "knock-in" models help to unravel the physiologic function of genes.

The astounding rate at which new genetic information is being generated creates a major challenge for physicians, health care providers, and basic investigators. The terminology and techniques used for discovery evolve continuously. Much genetic information resides in databases or is being published in basic science journals. Databases provide easy access to the expanding information about the human genome, genetic disease, and genetic testing (Table 61-1). For example, several thousand monogenic disorders are summarized in a large, continuously evolving compendium, referred to as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) catalogue (Table 61-1). The ongoing refinement of bioinformatics is simplifying the access to this daunting onslaught of new information.

Chromosomes and DNA Replication

Organization of DNA into Chromosomes

Size of the Human Genome

The human genome is divided into 23 different chromosomes, including 22 autosomes (numbered 1每22) and the X and Y sex chromosomes. Adult cells are diploid, meaning they contain two homologous sets of 22 autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). As a consequence of meiosis, germ cells (sperm or oocytes) are haploid and contain one set of 22 autosomes and one of the sex chromosomes. At the time of fertilization, the diploid genome is reconstituted by pairing of the homologous chromosomes from the mother and father. With each cell division (mitosis), chromosomes are replicated, paired, segregated, and divided into two daughter cells (Chap. 62).

Although the exact number of genes encoded by the human genome is still unknown, current estimates predict about 23,000 to 25,000 protein-coding genes, a number that is substantially smaller than initially predicted. A gene is a functional unit that is regulated by transcription (see below) and encodes an RNA product, which is most commonly, but not always, translated into a protein that exerts activity within or outside the cell. Historically, genes were identified because they conferred specific traits that are transmitted from one generation to the next. Increasingly, they are characterized based on expression in various tissues (transcriptome). The number of genes greatly underestimates the complexity of genetic expression, as single genes can generate multiple spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) products, which are translated into proteins that are subject to complex posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation. Proteomics, the study of the proteome using technologies of large-scale protein separation and identification, is focused on protein variation and function. Similarly, the field of metabolomics aims at determining the composition and modifications of the metabolome, the complement of low-molecular-weight molecules, many of which participate in various metabolic functions. The human microbiome refers to the constellation of viruses, bacteria, and fungi that colonize various human tissues (Chap. 64). Comprehensive characterization of the microbiome has been made feasible by the availability of high-throughput DNA-sequencing methods. Analyses of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome are heavily dependent on bioinformatics, and they are beginning to reveal how physiologic or pathologic alterations affect modular networks rather than linear pathways (Chap. e19).

Human DNA consists of 3 billion base pairs (bp) of DNA per haploid genome. DNA length is normally measured in units of 1000 bp (kilobases, kb) or 1,000,000 bp (megabases, Mb). Not all DNA encodes genes. In fact, genes account for only 10每15% of DNA. Much of the remaining DNA consists of highly repetitive sequences, the function of which is poorly understood. These repetitive DNA regions, along with nonrepetitive sequences that do not encode genes, may serve a structural role in the packaging of DNA into chromatin [i.e., DNA bound to histone proteins, and chromosomes (Fig. 61-1)]. If only 10% of DNA is expressed and there are 25,000 genes, the average gene would be 12 kb in length. Although many genes are about this size, the range is quite broad. For example, some genes are only a few hundred bp, whereas others such as the DMD gene, are extraordinarily large (2 Mb).

Figure 61-1

 
 
 
Structure of chromatin and chromosomes. Chromatin is composed of double-strand DNA that is wrapped around histone and non每histone proteins forming nucleosomes. The nucleosomes are further organized into solenoid structures. Chromosomes assume their characteristic structure, with short (p) and long (q) arms at the metaphase stage of the cell cycle.
 
 

Structure of DNA

Each gene is composed of a linear polymer of DNA. DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of four different bases: adenine (A), thymidine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Adenine is paired to thymidine, and guanine is paired to cytosine, by hydrogen bond interactions that span the double helix. DNA has several remarkable features that make it ideal for the transmission of genetic information. It is relatively stable, at least in comparison to RNA or proteins. The double-stranded nature of DNA and its feature of strict base-pair complementarity permit faithful replication during cell division. As described below, complementarity also allows the transmission of genetic information from DNA  RNA  protein (Fig. 61-2). mRNA is encoded by the so-called sense or coding strand of the DNA double helix and is translated into proteins by ribosomes.

Figure 61-2

 
 
 
Flow of genetic information. Multiple extracellular signals activate intracellular signal cascades that result in altered regulation of gene expression through the interaction of transcription factors with regulatory regions of genes. RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA that is processed to mRNA by excision of intronic sequences. The mRNA is translated into a polypeptide chain to form the mature protein after undergoing posttranslational processing. HAT, histone acetyl transferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cyclic AMP response element每binding protein; CRE, cyclic AMP responsive element; CoA, Co activator; TAF, TBP-associated factors; GTF, general transcription factors; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TATA, TATA box; RE, response element; NH2, aminoterminus; COOH, carboxyterminus.
 
 

The presence of four different bases provides surprising genetic diversity. In the protein-coding regions of genes, the DNA bases are arranged into codons, a triplet of bases that specifies a particular amino acid. It is possible to arrange the four bases into 64 different triplet codons (43). Each codon specifies 1 of the 20 different amino acids, or a regulatory signal such as initiation and stop of translation. Because there are more codons than amino acids, the genetic code is degenerate; that is, most amino acids can be specified by several different codons. By arranging the codons in different combinations and in various lengths, it is possible to generate the tremendous diversity of primary protein structure.

Replication of DNA and Mitosis

Genetic information in DNA is transmitted to daughter cells under two different circumstances: (1) somatic cells divide by mitosis, allowing the diploid (2n) genome to replicate itself completely in conjunction with cell division; and (2) germ cells (sperm and ova) undergo meiosis, a process that enables the reduction of the diploid (2n) set of chromosomes to the haploid state (1n) (Chap. 62).

Prior to mitosis, cells exit the resting, or G0 state, and enter the cell cycle (Chap. 84). After traversing a critical checkpoint in G1, cells undergo DNA synthesis (S phase), during which the DNA in each chromosome is replicated, yielding two pairs of sister chromatids (2n  4n). The process of DNA synthesis requires stringent fidelity in order to avoid transmitting errors to subsequent generations of cells. Genetic abnormalities of DNA mismatch/repair include xeroderma pigmentosum, Bloom's syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), among others. Many of these disorders strongly predispose to neoplasia because of the rapid acquisition of additional mutations (Chap. 83). After completion of DNA synthesis, cells enter G2 and progress through a second checkpoint before entering mitosis. At this stage, the chromosomes condense and are aligned along the equatorial plate at metaphase. The two identical sister chromatids, held together at the centromere, divide and migrate to opposite poles of the cell (Fig. 61-3). After formation of a nuclear membrane around the two separated sets of chromatids, the cell divides and two daughter cells are formed, thus restoring the diploid (2n) state.

Figure 61-3

 
 
 
Crossing-over and genetic recombination. During chiasma formation, either of the two sister chromatids on one chromosome pairs with one of the chromatids of the homologous chromosome. Genetic recombination occurs through crossing-over and results in recombinant and nonrecombinant chromosome segments in the gametes. Together with the random segregation of the maternal and paternal chromosomes, recombination contributes to genetic diversity and forms the basis of the concept of linkage.
 
 

Assortment and Segregation of Genes during Meiosis

Meiosis occurs only in germ cells of the gonads. It shares certain features with mitosis but involves two distinct steps of cell division that reduce the chromosome number to the haploid state. In addition, there is active recombination that generates genetic diversity. During the first cell division, two sister chromatids (2n  4n) are formed for each chromosome pair and there is an exchange of DNA between homologous paternal and maternal chromosomes. This process involves the formation of chiasmata, structures that correspond to the DNA segments that cross over between the maternal and paternal homologues (Fig. 61-3). Usually there is at least one crossover on each chromosomal arm; recombination occurs more frequently in female meiosis than in male meiosis. Subsequently, the chromosomes segregate randomly. Because there are 23 chromosomes, there exist 223 (>8 million) possible combinations of chromosomes. Together with the genetic exchanges that occur during recombination, chromosomal segregation generates tremendous diversity, and each gamete is genetically unique. The process of recombination, and the independent segregation of chromosomes, provide the foundation for performing linkage analyses, whereby one attempts to correlate the inheritance of certain chromosomal regions (or linked genes) with the presence of a disease or genetic trait (see below).

After the first meiotic division, which results in two daughter cells (2n), the two chromatids of each chromosome separate during a second meiotic division to yield four gametes with a haploid state (1n). When the egg is fertilized by sperm, the two haploid sets are combined, thereby restoring the diploid state (2n) in the zygote.

Regulation of Gene Expression

Mechanisms that regulate gene expression play a critical role in the function of genes. The transcription of genes is controlled primarily by transcription factors that bind to DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of genes. As described below, mutations in transcription factors cause a significant number of genetic disorders. Gene expression is also influenced by epigenetic events (epigenetics). DNA and histone modifications can result in the activation or silencing of gene expression (Fig. 61-4). They include heritable changes such as X-inactivation and imprinting, and dynamic alterations in response to environmental influences such as diet, age, or drugs. Epigenomics addresses epigenetic changes across the whole genome in a cell or organism. Several genetic disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome (neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, obesity, short stature, and hypogonadism) and Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (resistance to parathyroid hormone, short stature, brachydactyly, resistance to other hormones in certain subtypes), exhibit the consequences of genomic imprinting. Acquired modifications in DNA methylation occur during development and are found in cancer cells, likely contributing to cancer development and progression. Most studies of gene expression have focused on the regulatory DNA elements of genes that control transcription. However, it should be emphasized that gene expression requires a series of steps, including mRNA processing, protein translation, and posttranslational modifications, all of which are actively regulated (Fig. 61-2).

Figure 61-4

 
 
 
Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. Methylation of cytosine residues is associated with gene silencing. Methylation of certain genomic regions is inherited (imprinting) and is involved in the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in females (X-inactivation). Alterations in methylation can also be acquired (e.g. in cancer cells). Covalent posttranslational modifications of histones and other proteins play an important role in altering chromatin structure and, hence, transcription. Histones can be reversibly modified in their amino-terminal tails, which protrude from the nucleosome core particle, by acetylation of lysine, phosphorylation of serine, or methylation of lysine and arginine residues. Acetylation of histones by histone acetylases (HATs), for example, leads to unwinding of chromatin and accessibility to transcription factors. Conversely, deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs) results in a compact chromatin structure and silencing of transcription.
 
 

The field of functional genomics is based on the concept that understanding alterations of gene expression under various physiologic and pathologic conditions provides insight into the underlying processes, and by revealing certain gene expression profiles, this knowledge may be of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. The large-scale study of expression profiles, which takes advantage of microarray and bead array technologies, is also referred to as transcriptomics because the complement of mRNAs transcribed by the cellular genome is called the transcriptome.

Structure of Genes

A gene product is usually a protein but can occasionally consist of RNA that is not translated (e.g., microRNAs). Exons refer to the portion of genes that are eventually spliced together to form mRNA. Introns refer to the spacing regions between the exons that are spliced out of precursor RNAs during RNA processing. The gene locus also includes regions that are necessary to control its expression (Fig. 61-2).

The number of DNA sequences and transcription factors that regulate transcription is much greater than originally anticipated. Most genes contain at least 15每20 discrete regulatory elements within 300 bp of the transcription start site. This densely packed promoter region often contains binding sites for ubiquitous transcription factors such as CAAT box/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), cyclic AMP response element每binding (CREB) protein, selective promoter factor 1 (Sp-1), or activator protein 1 (AP-1). However, factors involved in cell-specific expression may also bind to these sequences. For example, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins bind to E-boxes in the promoters of myogenic genes, and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) binds to a specific recognition site in the regulatory region of multiple steroidogenic enzyme genes. Key regulatory elements may also reside at a large distance from the proximal promoter. The globin and the immunoglobulin genes, (e.g., contain locus control regions that are several kilobases away from the structural sequences of the gene). Specific groups of transcription factors that bind to these promoter and enhancer sequences provide a combinatorial code for regulating transcription. In this manner, relatively ubiquitous factors interact with more restricted factors to allow each gene to be expressed and regulated in a unique manner that is dependent on developmental state, cell type, and numerous extracellular stimuli. The transcription factors that bind to DNA actually represent only the first level of regulatory control. Other proteins〞co-activators and co-repressors〞interact with the DNA-binding transcription factors to generate large regulatory complexes. These complexes are subject to control by numerous cell-signaling pathways, including phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. Ultimately, the recruited transcription factors interact with, and stabilize, components of the basal transcription complex that assembles at the site of the TATA box and initiator region. This basal transcription factor complex consists of >30 different proteins. Gene transcription occurs when RNA polymerase begins to synthesize RNA from the DNA template. A growing number of identified genetic diseases involve transcription factors (Table 61-2).

Mutations can occur in all domains of a gene (Fig. 61-5). A point mutation occurring within the coding region leads to an amino acid substitution if the codon is altered. Point mutations that introduce a premature stop codon result in a truncated protein. Large deletions may affect a portion of a gene or an entire gene, whereas small deletions and insertions alter the reading frame if they do not represent a multiple of three bases. These "frameshift" mutations lead to an entirely altered carboxy terminus. Mutations occurring in regulatory or intronic regions may result in altered expression or splicing of genes. Examples are shown in Fig. 61-6.

Cloning and Sequencing DNA

A description of recombinant DNA techniques, the methodology used for the manipulation, analysis, and characterization of DNA segments, is beyond the scope of this chapter. These methods are now widely used in genetics and molecular diagnostics.

Transgenic Mice as Models of Genetic Disease

Several organisms have been studied extensively as genetic models, including Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), and Escherichia coli (colonic bacterium). The ability to use these evolutionarily distant organisms as genetic models that are relevant to human physiology reflects a surprising conservation of genetic pathways and gene function. Transgenic mouse models have been particularly valuable, because many human and mouse genes exhibit similar structure and function, and because manipulation of the mouse genome is relatively straightforward compared to those of other mammalian species.

Transgenic strategies in mice can be divided into two main approaches: (1) expression of a gene by random insertion into the genome, and (2) deletion or targeted mutagenesis of a gene by homologous recombination with the native endogenous gene (knock-out, knock-in) (Table 61-3).

Transgenic expression of genes can be useful for studying disorders that are sensitive to gene dosage. Overexpression of PMP22, for example, mimics a common duplication of this gene in type IA Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Chap. 384). Duplication of the PMP22 gene results in high levels of expression of peripheral myelin protein 22, and this dosage effect is responsible for the demyelinating neuropathy. Expression of the Y chromosome每specific gene, SRY, in XX females demonstrates that SRY is sufficient to induce the formation of testes. This finding confirms the pathogenic role of SRY translocations to the X chromosome in sex-reversed XX females. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract. Targeted deletion of the Huntington disease's(HD) gene does not induce the neurologic disorder. On the other hand, transgenic expression of the entire gene or of the first exon containing the sequence encoding the expanded polyglutamine repeat is sufficient to cause many features of the neurologic disorder, indicating a gain-of-function property for the expanded polyglutamine-containing protein. Transgenic strategies can also be used as precursors to gene therapy. Expression of dystrophin, the protein that is deleted in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, partially corrects the disorder in a mouse model of Duchenne's. Targeted expression of oncogenes has been valuable to study mechanisms of neoplasia and to generate immortalized cell lines. For example, expression of the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen under the direction of the insulin promoter induces the formation of islet cell tumors.

The creation of gene knock-out and knock-in models takes advantage of the fact that a segment of DNA can be substituted by another that is identical (homologous), or nearly identical, by recombination. This permits integration of deletions that disrupt the gene (knock-out) or selected mutations (knock-in) into the target gene of choice. Many of these gene knock-outs do not have an apparent phenotype, either because of redundant functions of the other genes or because the phenotype is subtle. For example, deletion of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene (Hprt) does not cause characteristic features of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in mice because of their reliance on adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) in the purine salvage pathway. Deletion of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene encoding p105 does not lead to retinoblastoma or other tumors that characterize the human syndrome. However, mice with combinatorial deletion of several Rb-related proteins exhibit features similar to the human disorder. These examples underscore the fact that the functions of genes, and their interactions with genetic background and the environment, are not necessarily identical in mice and humans. On the other hand, the deletion of many genes provides a remarkably faithful model of human disorders. In addition to clarifying pathophysiology, these models facilitate the development of therapies, both genetic and pharmaceutical.

Many variations of these basic approaches now exist that allow genes to be expressed or deleted in specific cell types, at different times during development, or at varying levels. Consequently, transgenic technology has emerged as a powerful strategy for defining the physiologic effects of deleting or overexpressing a gene, as well as providing unique genetic models for dissecting pathophysiology or testing therapies. In addition to transgenic animal models, naturally occurring mutations in mice and other species continue to provide fundamental insights into human disease. A compendium of natural and transgenic animal models is provided in continuously evolving databases (Table 61-1).

Implications of the Human Genome Project

The HGP was initiated in the mid-1980s as an ambitious effort to characterize the human genome, culminating in a complete DNA sequence. The initial main goals were (1) creation of genetic maps, (2) development of physical maps, and (3) determination of the complete human DNA sequence. Some analogies help in appreciating the scope of the HGP. The 23 pairs of human chromosomes encode 23,000每30,000 genes. The total length of DNA is 3 billion bp, which is nearly 1000-fold greater than that of the E. coli genome. If the human DNA sequence were printed out, it would correspond to about 120 volumes of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.

The identification of the 10 million SNPs estimated to occur in the human genome has generated a catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in human beings from distinct ethnic backgrounds (Fig. 61-7). SNPs that are in close proximity are inherited together (i.e., they are linked) and are referred to as haplotypes, hence the name HapMap (Fig. 61-8). The HapMap describes the nature and location of these SNP haplotypes and how they are distributed among individuals within and among populations. The HapMap information is greatly facilitating GWAS designed to elucidate the complex interactions among multiple genes and lifestyle factors in multifactorial disorders (see below). Moreover, haplotype analyses will be useful to assess variations in responses to medications (pharmacogenomics) and environmental factors, as well as the prediction of disease predisposition.

Chromosome 7 is shown with the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes above. A 200-kb region in 7q31.2 containing the CFTR gene is shown below. The CFTR gene contains 27 exons. More than 1790 mutations in this gene have been found in patients with cystic fibrosis. A 20-kb region encompassing exons 4每9 is shown further amplified in order to illustrate the SNPs in this region.

The origin of haplotypes is due to repeated recombination events occurring in multiple generations. Over time, this leads to distinct haplotypes. These haplotype blocks can often be characterized by genotyping selected Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms, an approach that now facilitates performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
 
 

The Human DNA Sequence

The complete DNA sequence of each chromosome provides the highest-resolution physical map. The primary focus of the HGP was to obtain DNA sequence for the entire human genome as well as model organisms. Although the prospect of determining the complete sequence of the human genome seemed daunting several years ago, technical advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics led to the completion of a draft human sequence in June 2000, well in advance of the original goal year of 2003. High-quality reference sequences, completed in 2003, further closed gaps and reduced remaining ambiguities, and the HGP announced the completion of the DNA sequence for the last of the human chromosomes in May 2006. The Personal Genome Project (PGP) launched in 2006 aims to completely sequence the genomes from multiple individuals and to associate them with health and physical information to enhance our understanding of human (patho)physiology. A variety of technical advances in DNA sequencing and computational analyses may soon reduce the cost of obtaining a complete human genome sequence to close to US $1,000. In addition to the human genome, the genomes of numerous organisms have been sequenced completely ( 1000) or partially ( 5500) [Genomes Online Database (GOLD); Table 61-1]. They include, among others, eukaryotes such as man and mouse; S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster; bacteria (e.g., E. coli); and archeae, viruses, organelles (mitochondriae, chloroplasts), and plants (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana). This information, together with technological advances and refinement of computational bioinformatics, has led to a fast-paced transition from the study of single genes to whole genomes. The current directions arising from the HGP include, among others, (1) the comparison of entire genomes (comparative genomics), (2) the study of large-scale expression of RNAs (functional genomics) and proteins (proteomics) in order to detect differences between various tissues in health and disease, (3) the characterization of the variation among individuals by establishing catalogues of sequence variations and SNPs (HapMap project) and the Personal Genome Project, and (4) the identification of genes that play critical roles in the development of polygenic and multifactorial disorders.

Ethical Issues

Implicit in the HGP is the concept that identifying disease-causing genes can lead to improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Most individuals can be expected to harbor several serious recessive gene mutations. Completion of the human genome sequence, determination of the association of genetic defects with disease, and studies of genetic variation raise many new issues with implications for the individual and mankind. The controversies concerning the cloning of mammals, the establishment of human ES cells, and the creation of synthetic organisms underscore the relevance of these questions. Moreover, the information gleaned from genotypic results can have quite different impacts, depending on the availability of strategies to modify the course of disease. For example, the identification of mutations that cause multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 or hemochromatosis allows specific interventions for affected family members. On the other hand, at present, the identification of an Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease gene does not alter therapy and outcomes. However, the progress in this area is unpredictable, as underscored by the finding that angiotensin II receptor blockers may slow disease progression in Marfan's syndrome.

Genetic test results can generate anxiety in affected individuals and family members, and there is the possibility of discrimination on the basis of the test results. Most genetic disorders are likely to fall into an intermediate category where the opportunity for prevention or treatment is significant but limited (Chap. 63). For these reasons, the scientific components of the HGP have been paralleled by efforts to examine ethical, social, and legal implications as new issues arise.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), signed into law in 2008, aims to protect individuals against the misuse of genetic information for health insurance and employment. The impact of genetic testing on health care costs is currently unclear. It is likely to vary among disorders and depend on the availability of effective therapeutic modalities. A significant problem arises from the marketing of genetic testing directly to consumers by commercial companies. The validity of these tests has not been defined and there are numerous concerns about the lack of appropriate regulatory oversight, the accuracy and confidentiality of genetic information, the availability of counseling, and the handling of these results.

Many issues raised by the genome project are familiar, in principle, to medical practitioners. For example, an asymptomatic patient with increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high blood pressure, or a strong family history of early myocardial infarction is known to be at increased risk of coronary heart disease. In such cases, it is clear that the identification of risk factors and an appropriate intervention are beneficial. Likewise, patients with phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell anemia are often identified as having a genetic disease early in life. These precedents can be helpful for adapting policies that relate to genetic information. We can anticipate similar efforts, whether based on genotypes or other markers of genetic predisposition, to be applied to many disorders. One confounding aspect of the rapid expansion of information is that our ability to make clinical decisions often lags behind initial insights into genetic mechanisms of disease. For example, when genes that predispose to breast cancer such as BRCA1 are described, they generate tremendous public interest in the potential to predict disease, but many years of clinical research are still required to rigorously establish genotype and phenotype correlations.

Whether related to informed consent, participation in research, or the management of a genetic disorder that affects an individual or their families, there is a great need for more information about fundamental principles of genetics. The pervasive nature of the role of genetics in medicine makes it imperative for physicians and other health care professionals to become more informed about genetics and to provide advice and counseling in conjunction with trained genetic counselors (Chap. 63). The application of screening and prevention strategies will therefore require intensive patient and physician education, changes in health care financing, and legislation to protect patient's rights.

Genomics and Global Health

Genomics may contribute to improvements in global health by providing a better understanding of pathogens and diagnostics, and through contributions to drug development. There is, however, concern about the development of a "genomics divide" because of the costs associated with these developments and uncertainty as to whether these advances will be accessible to the populations of developing countries. The World Health Organization has summarized the current issues and inequities surrounding genomic medicine in a detailed report on Genomics and World Health.

Transmission of Genetic Disease

Origins and Types of Mutations

A mutation can be defined as any change in the primary nucleotide sequence of DNA regardless of its functional consequences. Some mutations may be lethal, others are less deleterious, and some may confer an evolutionary advantage. Mutations can occur in the germline (sperm or oocytes); these can be transmitted to progeny. Alternatively, mutations can occur during embryogenesis or in somatic tissues. Mutations that occur during development lead to mosaicism, a situation in which tissues are composed of cells with different genetic constitutions. If the germline is mosaic, a mutation can be transmitted to some progeny but not others, which sometimes leads to confusion in assessing the pattern of inheritance. Somatic mutations that do not affect cell survival can sometimes be detected because of variable phenotypic effects in tissues (e.g., pigmented lesions in McCune-Albright syndrome). Other somatic mutations are associated with neoplasia because they confer a growth advantage to cells. Epigenetic events, heritable changes that do not involve changes in gene sequence (e.g., altered DNA methylation), may influence gene expression or facilitate genetic damage. With the exception of triplet nucleotide repeats, which can expand (see below), mutations are usually stable.

Mutations are structurally diverse'they can involve the entire genome, as in triploidy (one extra set of chromosomes), or gross numerical or structural alterations in chromosomes or individual genes (Chap. 62). Large deletions may affect a portion of a gene or an entire gene, or, if several genes are involved, they may lead to a contiguous gene syndrome. Unequal crossing-over between homologous genes can result in fusion gene mutations, as illustrated by color blindness (Chap. 28). Mutations involving single nucleotides are referred to as point mutations. Substitutions are called transitions if a purine is replaced by another purine base (A  G) or if a pyrimidine is replaced by another pyrimidine (C  T). Changes from a purine to a pyrimidine, or vice versa, are referred to as transversions. If the DNA sequence change occurs in a coding region and alters an amino acid, it is called a missense mutation. Depending on the functional consequences of such a missense mutation, amino acid substitutions in different regions of the protein can lead to distinct phenotypes. Polymorphisms are sequence variations that have a frequency of at least 1%. Usually, they do not result in a perceptible phenotype. Often they consist of single base-pair substitutions that do not alter the protein coding sequence because of the degenerate nature of the genetic code (synonymous polymorphism), although it is possible that some might alter mRNA stability, translation, or the amino acid sequence (nonsynonymous polymorphism) (Fig. 61-7). These types of base substitutions are encountered frequently during genetic testing and must be distinguished from true mutations that alter protein expression or function. Small nucleotide deletions or insertions cause a shift of the codon reading frame (frameshift). Most commonly, reading frame alterations result in an abnormal protein segment of variable length before termination of translation occurs at a stop codon (nonsense mutation) (Fig. 61-6). Mutations in intronic sequences or in exon junctions may destroy or create splice donor or splice acceptor sites. Mutations may also be found in the regulatory sequences of genes, resulting in reduced gene transcription.

Mutation Rates

As noted before, mutations represent an important cause of genetic diversity as well as disease. Mutation rates are difficult to determine in humans because many mutations are silent and because testing is often not adequate to detect the phenotypic consequences. Mutation rates vary in different genes but are estimated to occur at a rate of 10每10/bp per cell division. Germline mutation rates (as opposed to somatic mutations) are relevant in the transmission of genetic disease. Because the population of oocytes is established very early in development, only 20 cell divisions are required for completed oogenesis, whereas spermatogenesis involves 30 divisions by the time of puberty and 20 cell divisions each year thereafter. Consequently, the probability of acquiring new point mutations is much greater in the male germline than the female germline, in which rates of aneuploidy are increased (Chap. 62). Thus, the incidence of new point mutations in spermatogonia increases with paternal age (e.g., achondrodysplasia, Marfan's syndrome, neurofibromatosis). It is estimated that about 1 in 10 sperm carries a new deleterious mutation. The rates for new mutations are calculated most readily for autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders and are 10每5每10每6/locus per generation. Because most monogenic diseases are relatively rare, new mutations account for a significant fraction of cases. This is important in the context of genetic counseling, as a new mutation can be transmitted to the affected individual but does not necessarily imply that the parents are at risk to transmit the disease to other children. An exception to this is when the new mutation occurs early in germline development, leading to gonadal mosaicism.

Unequal Crossing-over

Normally, DNA recombination in germ cells occurs with remarkable fidelity to maintain the precise junction sites for the exchanged DNA sequences (Fig. 61-3). However, mispairing of homologous sequences leads to unequal crossover, with gene duplication on one of the chromosomes and gene deletion on the other chromosome. A significant fraction of growth hormone (GH) gene deletions, for example, involve unequal crossing-over (Chap. 339). The GH gene is a member of a large gene cluster that includes a gh variant gene as well as several structurally related chorionic somatomammotropin genes and pseudogenes (highly homologous but functionally inactive relatives of a normal gene). Because such gene clusters contain multiple homologous DNA sequences arranged in tandem, they are particularly prone to undergo recombination and, consequently, gene duplication or deletion. On the other hand, duplication of the PMP22 gene because of unequal crossing-over results in increased gene dosage and type IA Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Unequal crossing-over resulting in deletion of PMP22 causes a distinct neuropathy called hereditary liability to pressure palsy (Chap. 384).

Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) is caused by a rearrangement involving the genes that encode aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and steroid 11-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), normally arranged in tandem on chromosome 8q. These two genes are 95% identical, predisposing to gene duplication and deletion by unequal crossing-over. The rearranged gene product contains the regulatory regions of 11-hydroxylase fused to the coding sequence of aldosterone synthetase. Consequently, the latter enzyme is expressed in the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)每dependent zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland, resulting in overproduction of mineralocorticoids and hypertension (Chap. 342).

Gene conversion refers to a nonreciprocal exchange of homologous genetic information; it is probably more common than generally recognized. In human genetics, gene conversion has been used to explain how an internal portion of a gene is replaced by a homologous segment copied from another allele or locus; these genetic alterations may range from a few nucleotides to a few thousand nucleotides. As a result of gene conversion, it is possible for short DNA segments of two chromosomes to be identical, even though these sequences are distinct in the parents. A practical consequence of this phenomenon is that nucleotide substitutions can occur during gene conversion between related genes, often altering the function of the gene. In disease states, gene conversion often involves intergenic exchange of DNA between a gene and a related pseudogene. For example, the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2) is adjacent to a nonfunctional pseudogene (CYP21A1P). Many of the nucleotide substitutions that are found in the CYP21A2 gene in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia correspond to sequences that are present in the CYP21A1P pseudogene, suggesting gene conversion as a mechanism of mutagenesis. In addition, mitotic gene conversion has been suggested as a mechanism to explain revertant mosaicism in which an inherited mutation is "corrected" in certain cells. For example, patients with autosomal recessive generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa have acquired reverse mutations in one of the two mutated COL17A1 alleles, leading to clinically unaffected patches of skin.

Insertions and Deletions

Although many instances of insertions and deletions occur as a consequence of unequal crossing-over, there is also evidence for internal duplication, inversion, or deletion of DNA sequences. The fact that certain deletions or insertions appear to occur repeatedly as independent events suggests that specific regions within the DNA sequence predispose to these errors. For example, certain regions of the DMD gene appear to be hot spots for deletions. Some regions within the human genome are rearrangement hot spots and lead to copy number variations (CNVs).

Errors in DNA Repair

Because mutations caused by defects in DNA repair accumulate as somatic cells divide, these types of mutations are particularly important in the context of neoplastic disorders (Chap. 84). Several genetic disorders involving DNA repair enzymes underscore their importance. Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum have defects in DNA damage recognition or in the nucleotide excision and repair pathway (Chap. 87). Exposed skin is dry and pigmented and is extraordinarily sensitive to the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet irradiation. More than 10 different genes have been shown to cause the different forms of xeroderma pigmentosum. This finding is consistent with the earlier classification of this disease into different complementation groups in which normal function is rescued by the fusion of cells derived from two different forms of xeroderma pigmentosum.

Ataxia telangiectasia causes large telangiectatic lesions of the face, cerebellar ataxia, immunologic defects, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (Chap. 373). The discovery of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene reveals that it is homologous to genes involved in DNA repair and control of cell cycle checkpoints. Mutations in the ATM gene give rise to defects in meiosis as well as increasing susceptibility to damage from ionizing radiation. Fanconi's anemia is also associated with an increased risk of multiple acquired genetic abnormalities. It is characterized by diverse congenital anomalies and a strong predisposition to develop aplastic anemia and acute myelogenous leukemia (Chap. 109). Cells from these patients are susceptible to chromosomal breaks caused by a defect in genetic recombination. At least 13 different complementation groups have been identified, and several loci and genes associated with Fanconi's anemia have been mapped or cloned. HNPCC (Lynch's syndrome) is characterized by autosomal dominant transmission of colon cancer, young age (<50 years) of presentation, predisposition to lesions in the proximal large bowel, and associated malignancies such as uterine cancer and ovarian cancer. HNPCC is predominantly caused by mutations in one of several different mismatch repair (MMR) genes including MutS homologue 2 (MSH2), MutL homologue 1 and 6 (MLH1, MLH6), MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2 (Chap. 91). These proteins are involved in the detection of nucleotide mismatches and in the recognition of slipped-strand trinucleotide repeats. Germline mutations in these genes lead to microsatellite instability and a high mutation rate in colon cancer. Genetic screening tests for this disorder are now being used for families considered to be at risk (Chap. 63). Recognition of HNPCC allows early screening with colonoscopy and the implementation of prevention strategies using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Dipyrimidine and CpG Sequences

Certain DNA sequences are particularly susceptible to mutagenesis. Successive pyrimidine residues (e.g., T-T or C-C) are subject to the formation of ultraviolet light每induced photoadducts. If these pyrimidine dimers are not repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway, mutations will be introduced after DNA synthesis. The dinucleotide C-G, or CpG, is also a hot spot for a specific type of mutation. In this case, methylation of the cytosine is associated with an enhanced rate of deamination to uracil, which is then replaced with thymine. This C  T transition (or G  A on the opposite strand) accounts for at least one-third of point mutations associated with polymorphisms and mutations. Many of the MSH2 mutations in HNPCC, for example, involve CpG sequences. In addition to the fact that certain types of mutations (C  T or G  A) are relatively common, the nature of the genetic code also results in overrepresentation of certain amino acid substitutions.

Unstable DNA Sequences

Trinucleotide repeats may be unstable and expand beyond a critical number. Mechanistically, the expansion is thought to be caused by unequal recombination and slipped mispairing. A premutation represents a small increase in trinucleotide copy number. In subsequent generations, the expanded repeat may increase further in length and result in an increasingly severe phenotype, a process called dynamic mutation (see below for discussion of anticipation). Trinucleotide expansion was first recognized as a cause of the fragile X syndrome, one of the most common causes of mental retardation. Other disorders arising from a similar mechanism include Huntington's disease (Chap. 371), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Chap. 374), and myotonic dystrophy (Chap. 387). Malignant cells are also characterized by genetic instability, indicating a breakdown in mechanisms that regulate DNA repair and the cell cycle.

Functional Consequences of Mutations

Functionally, mutations can be broadly classified as gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations. Gain-of-function mutations are typically dominant (i.e., they result in phenotypic alterations when a single allele is affected). Inactivating mutations are usually recessive, and an affected individual is homozygous or compound heterozygous (e.g., carrying two different mutant alleles of the same gene) for the disease-causing mutations. Alternatively, mutation in a single allele can result in haploinsufficiency, a situation in which one normal allele is not sufficient to maintain a normal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency is a commonly observed mechanism in diseases associated with mutations in transcription factors (Table 61-2). Remarkably, the clinical features among patients with an identical mutation in a transcription factor often vary significantly. One mechanism underlying this variability consists in the influence of modifying genes. Haploinsufficiency can also affect the expression of rate-limiting enzymes. For example, haploinsufficiency in enzymes involved in heme synthesis can cause porphyrias (Chap. 358).

An increase in dosage of a gene product may also result in disease, as illustrated by the duplication of the DAX1 gene in dosage-sensitive sex-reversal (Chap. 349). Mutation in a single allele can also result in loss of function due to a dominant-negative effect. In this case, the mutated allele interferes with the function of the normal gene product by one of several different mechanisms: (1) a mutant protein may interfere with the function of a multimeric protein complex, as illustrated by mutations in type 1 collagen (COL1A1, COL1A2) genes in osteogenesis imperfecta (Chap. 363); (2) a mutant protein may occupy binding sites on proteins or promoter response elements, as illustrated by thyroid hormone resistance, a disorder in which inactivated thyroid hormone receptor binds to target genes and functions as an antagonist of normal receptors (Chap. 341); or (3) a mutant protein can be cytotoxic as in 1 antitrypsin deficiency (Chap. 260) or autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (Chap. 340), in which the abnormally folded proteins are trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately cause cellular damage.

Genotype and Phenotype

Alleles, Genotypes, and Haplotypes

An observed trait is referred to as a phenotype; the genetic information defining the phenotype is called the genotype. Alternative forms of a gene or a genetic marker are referred to as alleles. Alleles may be polymorphic variants of nucleic acids that have no apparent effect on gene expression or function. In other instances, these variants may have subtle effects on gene expression, thereby conferring the adaptive advantages associated with genetic diversity. On the other hand, allelic variants may reflect mutations in a gene that clearly alter its function. The common Glu6Val (E6V) sickle cell mutation in the -globin gene and the F508 deletion of phenylalanine (F) in the CFTR gene are examples of allelic variants of these genes that result in disease. Because each individual has two copies of each chromosome (one inherited from the mother and one inherited from the father), he or she can have only two alleles at a given locus. However, there can be many different alleles in the population. The normal or common allele is usually referred to as wild type. When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 61-6). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus.

Genotypes describe the specific alleles at a particular locus. For example, there are three common alleles (E2, E3, E4) of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The genotype of an individual can therefore be described as APOE3/4 or APOE4/4 or any other variant. These designations indicate which alleles are present on the two chromosomes in the APOE gene at locus 19q13.2. In other cases, the genotype might be assigned arbitrary numbers (e.g., 1/2) or letters (e.g., B/b) to distinguish different alleles.

A haplotype refers to a group of alleles that are closely linked together at a genomic locus (Fig. 61-8). Haplotypes are useful for tracking the transmission of genomic segments within families and for detecting evidence of genetic recombination, if the crossover event occurs between the alleles (Fig. 61-3). As an example, various alleles at the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) on chromosome 6p are used to establish haplotypes associated with certain disease states. For example, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, complement deficiency, and hemochromatosis are each associated with specific HLA haplotypes. It is now recognized that these genes lie in close vicinity to the HLA locus, which explains why HLA associations were identified even before the disease genes were cloned and localized. In other cases, specific HLA associations with diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (HLA-B27) or type 1 diabetes mellitus (HLA-DR4) reflect the role of specific HLA allelic variants in susceptibility to these autoimmune diseases. The characterization of common SNP haplotypes in numerous populations from different parts of the world through the HapMap project is providing a novel tool for association studies designed to detect genes involved in the pathogenesis of complex disorders (Table 61-1). The presence or absence of certain haplotypes may also become relevant for the customized choice of medical therapies (pharmacogenomics) or for preventive strategies.

Allelic Heterogeneity

Allelic heterogeneity refers to the fact that different mutations in the same genetic locus can cause an identical or similar phenotype. For example, many different mutations of the -globin locus can cause -thalassemia (Table 61-4) (Fig. 61-5). In essence, allelic heterogeneity reflects the fact that many different mutations are capable of altering protein structure and function. For this reason, maps of inactivating mutations in genes usually show a near-random distribution. Exceptions include (1) a founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; (2) "hot spots" for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and (3) localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function. Allelic heterogeneity creates a practical problem for genetic testing because one must often examine the entire genetic locus for mutations, as these can differ in each patient. For example, there are currently 1795 reported mutations in the CFTR gene (Fig. 61-7). The mutational analysis initially focuses on a panel of mutations that are particularly frequent (often taking the ethnic background of the patient into account), but a negative result does not exclude the presence of a mutation elsewhere in the gene. One should also be aware that mutational analyses generally focus on the coding region of a gene without considering regulatory and intronic regions. Because disease-causing mutations may be located outside the coding regions, negative results should be interpreted with caution. It is expected that the advent of more comprehensive sequencing technologies will greatly facilitate mutational analyses. It will, however, also introduce challenges because the detection of a sequence alteration alone is not always sufficient to establish that it has a causal role.

Phenotypic Heterogeneity

Phenotypic heterogeneity occurs when more than one phenotype is caused by allelic mutations (i.e., different mutations in the same gene) (Table 61-4). For example, laminopathies are monogenic multisystem disorders that result from mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear lamins A and C. Twelve autosomal dominant and four autosomal recessive disorders are caused by mutations in the LMNA gene. They include several forms of lipodystrophies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, progeria syndromes, a form of neuronal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 2B1), and a group of overlapping syndromes. Remarkably, hierarchical cluster analysis has revealed that the phenotypes vary depending on the position of the mutation. Similarly, identical mutations in the FGFR2 gene can result in very distinct phenotypes: Crouzon's syndrome (craniofacial synostosis) or Pfeiffer's syndrome (acrocephalopolysyndactyly).

Locus or Nonallelic Heterogeneity and Phenocopies

Nonallelic or locus heterogeneity refers to the situation in which a similar disease phenotype results from mutations at different genetic loci. This often occurs when more than one gene product produces different subunits of an interacting complex or when different genes are involved in the same genetic cascade or physiologic pathway. For example, osteogenesis imperfecta can arise from mutations in two different procollagen genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) that are located on different chromosomes (Chap. 363). The effects of inactivating mutations in these two genes are similar because the protein products comprise different subunits of the helical collagen fiber. Similarly, muscular dystrophy syndromes can be caused by mutations in various genes, consistent with the fact that it can be transmitted in an X-linked (Duchenne or Becker), autosomal dominant (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1), or autosomal recessive (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2) manner (Chap. 387). Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy. This feature reflects the large size of the gene as well as the fact that the phenotype is expressed in hemizygous males because they have only a single copy of the X chromosome. Dystrophin is associated with a large protein complex linked to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton in muscle. Mutations in several different components of this protein complex can also cause muscular dystrophy syndromes. Although the phenotypic features of some of these disorders are distinct, the phenotypic spectrum caused by mutations in different genes overlaps, thereby leading to nonallelic heterogeneity. It should be noted that mutations in dystrophin also cause allelic heterogeneity. For example, mutations in the DMD gene can cause either Duchenne's or the less severe Becker's muscular dystrophy, depending on the severity of the protein defect.

Recognition of nonallelic heterogeneity is important for several reasons: (1) the ability to identify disease loci in linkage studies is reduced by including patients with similar phenotypes but different genetic disorders; (2) genetic testing is more complex because several different genes need to be considered along with the possibility of different mutations in each of the candidate genes; and (3) novel information is gained about how genes or proteins interact, providing unique insights into molecular physiology.

Phenocopies refer to circumstances in which nongenetic conditions mimic a genetic disorder. For example, features of toxin- or drug-induced neurologic syndromes can resemble those seen in Huntington's disease, and vascular causes of dementia share phenotypic features with familial forms of Alzheimer's dementia (Chap. 371). Children born with activating mutations of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) exhibit goiter and thyrotoxicosis similar to that seen in neonatal Graves' disease, which is caused by the transfer of maternal autoantibodies to the fetus (Chap. 341). As in nonallelic heterogeneity, the presence of phenocopies has the potential to confound linkage studies and genetic testing. Patient history and subtle differences in phenotype can often provide clues that distinguish these disorders from related genetic conditions.

Variable Expressivity and Incomplete Penetrance

The same genetic mutation may be associated with a phenotypic spectrum in different affected individuals, thereby illustrating the phenomenon of variable expressivity. This may include different manifestations of a disorder variably involving different organs (e.g., MEN), the severity of the disorder (e.g., cystic fibrosis), or the age of disease onset (e.g., Alzheimer's dementia). MEN-1 illustrates several of these features. Families with this autosomal dominant disorder develop tumors of the parathyroid gland, endocrine pancreas, and the pituitary gland (Chap. 351). However, the pattern of tumors in the different glands, the age at which tumors develop, and the types of hormones produced vary among affected individuals, even within a given family. In this example, the phenotypic variability arises, in part, because of the requirement for a second mutation in the normal copy of the MEN1 gene, as well as the large array of different cell types that are susceptible to the effects of MEN1 gene mutations. In part, variable expression reflects the influence of modifier genes, or genetic background, on the effects of a particular mutation. Even in identical twins, in whom the genetic constitution is essentially the same, one can occasionally see variable expression of a genetic disease.

Interactions with the environment can also influence the course of a disease. For example, the manifestations and severity of hemochromatosis can be influenced by iron intake (Chap. 357), and the course of phenylketonuria is affected by exposure to phenylalanine in the diet (Chap. 364). Other metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemias and porphyria, also fall into this category. Many mechanisms, including genetic effects and environmental influences, can therefore lead to variable expressivity. In genetic counseling, it is particularly important to recognize this variability, as one cannot always predict the course of disease, even when the mutation is known.

Penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals with a mutant genotype that express the phenotype. If all carriers of a mutant express the phenotype, penetrance is complete, whereas it is said to be incomplete or reduced if some individuals do not have any features of the phenotype. Dominant conditions with incomplete penetrance are characterized by skipping of generations with unaffected carriers transmitting the mutant gene. For example, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by mutations in the myosin-binding protein C gene is a dominant disorder with clinical features in only a subset of patients who carry the mutation (Chap. 237). Patients who have the mutation but no evidence of the disease can still transmit the disorder to subsequent generations. In many conditions with postnatal onset, the proportion of gene carriers who are affected varies with age. Thus, when describing penetrance, one has to specify age. For example, for disorders such as Huntington's disease or familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which present late in life, the rate of penetrance is influenced by the age at which the clinical assessment is performed. Imprinting can also modify the penetrance of a disease (see below). For example, in patients with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, mutations in the Gs subunit (GNAS1 gene) are expressed clinically only in individuals who inherit the mutation from their mother (Chap. 353).

Sex-Influenced Phenotypes

Certain mutations affect males and females quite differently. In some instances, this is because the gene resides on the X or Y sex chromosomes (X-linked disorders and Y-linked disorders). As a result, the phenotype of mutated X-linked genes will be expressed fully in males but variably in heterozygous females, depending on the degree of X-inactivation and the function of the gene. For example, most heterozygous female carriers of factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) are asymptomatic because sufficient factor VIII is produced to prevent a defect in coagulation (Chap. 116). On the other hand, some females heterozygous for the X-linked lipid storage defect caused by -galactosidase A deficiency (Fabry's disease) experience mild manifestations of painful neuropathy, as well as other features of the disease (Chap. 361). Because only males have a Y chromosome, mutations in genes such as SRY, which causes male-to-female sex-reversal, or DAZ (deleted in azoospermia), which causes abnormalities of spermatogenesis, are unique to males (Chap. 349).

Other diseases are expressed in a sex-limited manner because of the differential function of the gene product in males and females. Activating mutations in the luteinizing hormone receptor cause dominant male-limited precocious puberty in boys (Chap. 346). The phenotype is unique to males because activation of the receptor induces testosterone production in the testis, whereas it is functionally silent in the immature ovary. Biallelic inactivating mutations of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor cause primary ovarian failure in females because the follicles do not develop in the absence of FSH action. In contrast, affected males have a more subtle phenotype, because testosterone production is preserved (allowing sexual maturation) and spermatogenesis is only partially impaired (Chap. 346). In congenital adrenal hyperplasia, most commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency, cortisol production is impaired and ACTH stimulation of the adrenal gland leads to increased production of androgenic precursors (Chap. 342). In females, the increased androgen level causes ambiguous genitalia, which can be recognized at the time of birth. In males, the diagnosis may be made on the basis of adrenal insufficiency at birth, because the increased adrenal androgen level does not alter sexual differentiation, or later in childhood, because of the development of precocious puberty. Hemochromatosis is more common in males than in females, presumably because of differences in dietary iron intake and losses associated with menstruation and pregnancy in females (Chap. 357).

Chromosomal Disorders

Chromosomal or cytogenetic disorders are caused by numerical or structural aberrations in chromosomes. Deviations in chromosome number are common causes of abortions, developmental disorders, and malformations. Contiguous gene syndromes (i.e., large deletions affecting several genes), have been useful for identifying the location of new disease-causing genes. Because of the variable size of gene deletions in different patients, a systematic comparison of phenotypes and locations of deletion breakpoints allows positions of particular genes to be mapped within the critical genomic region.

For discussion of disorders of chromosome number and structure, see Chap. 62.

Monogenic Mendelian Disorders

Monogenic human diseases are frequently referred to as Mendelian disorders because they obey the principles of genetic transmission originally set forth in Gregor Mendel's classic work. The continuously updated OMIM catalogue lists several thousand of these disorders and provides information about the clinical phenotype, molecular basis, allelic variants, and pertinent animal models (Table 61-1). The mode of inheritance for a given phenotypic trait or disease is determined by pedigree analysis. All affected and unaffected individuals in the family are recorded in a pedigree using standard symbols (Fig. 61-9). The principles of allelic segregation, and the transmission of alleles from parents to children, are illustrated in Fig. 61-10. One dominant (A) allele and one recessive (a) allele can display three Mendelian modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-chromosomal. About 65% of human monogenic disorders are autosomal dominant, 25% are autosomal recessive, and 5% are X-linked. Genetic testing is now available for many of these disorders and plays an increasingly important role in clinical medicine (Chap. 63).

Autosomal Dominant Disorders

Autosomal dominant disorders assume particular relevance because mutations in a single allele are sufficient to cause the disease. In contrast to recessive disorders, in which disease pathogenesis is relatively straightforward because there is loss of gene function, dominant disorders can be caused by various disease mechanisms, many of which are unique to the function of the genetic pathway involved.

In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the offspring of unaffected individuals. Males and females are affected with equal frequency because the defective gene resides on one of the 22 autosomes (Fig. 61-11A). Autosomal dominant mutations alter one of the two alleles at a given locus. Because the alleles segregate randomly at meiosis, the probability that an offspring will be affected is 50%. Unless there is a new germline mutation, an affected individual has an affected parent. Children with a normal genotype do not transmit the disorder. Due to differences in penetrance or expressivity (see above), the clinical manifestations of autosomal dominant disorders may be variable. Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance.

It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan's syndrome is 37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of 30 years.

Autosomal Recessive Disorders

In recessive disorders, the mutated alleles result in a complete or partial loss of function. They frequently involve enzymes in metabolic pathways, receptors, or proteins in signaling cascades. In an autosomal recessive disease, the affected individual, who can be of either sex, is a homozygote or compound heterozygote for a single-gene defect. With a few important exceptions, autosomal recessive diseases are rare and often occur in the context of parental consanguinity. The relatively high frequency of certain recessive disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and thalassemia, is partially explained by a selective biologic advantage for the heterozygous state (see below). Though heterozygous carriers of a defective allele are usually clinically normal, they may display subtle differences in phenotype that only become apparent with more precise testing or in the context of certain environmental influences. In sickle cell anemia, for example, heterozygotes are normally asymptomatic. However, in situations of dehydration or diminished oxygen pressure, sickle cell crises can also occur in heterozygotes (Chap. 104).

In most instances, an affected individual is the offspring of heterozygous parents. In this situation, there is a 25% chance that the offspring will have a normal genotype, a 50% probability of a heterozygous state, and a 25% risk of homozygosity for the recessive alleles (Figs. 61-10, 61-11B). In the case of one unaffected heterozygous and one affected homozygous parent, the probability of disease increases to 50% for each child. In this instance, the pedigree analysis mimics an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (pseudodominance). In contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, new mutations in recessive alleles are rarely manifest because they usually result in an asymptomatic carrier state.

X-Linked Disorders

Males have only one X chromosome; consequently, a daughter always inherits her father's X chromosome in addition to one of her mother's two X chromosomes. A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 61-11C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant phenotype in women. In addition, the expression of X-chromosomal genes is influenced by X chromosome inactivation (see below).

Y-Linked Disorders

The Y chromosome has a relatively small number of genes. One such gene, the sex-region determining Y factor (SRY), which encodes the testis-determining factor (TDF), is crucial for normal male development. Normally there is infrequent exchange of sequences on the Y chromosome with the X chromosome. The SRY region is adjacent to the pseudoautosomal region, a chromosomal segment on the X and Y chromosomes with a high degree of homology. A crossing-over occasionally involves the SRY region with the distal tip of the X chromosome during meiosis in the male. Translocations can result in XY females with the Y chromosome lacking the SRY gene or XX males harboring the SRY gene on one of the X chromosomes (Chap. 349). Point mutations in the SRY gene may also result in individuals with an XY genotype and an incomplete female phenotype. Most of these mutations occur de novo. Men with oligospermia/azoospermia frequently have microdeletions on the long arm of the Y chromosome that involve one or more of the azoospermia factor (AZF) genes.

Exceptions to Simple Mendelian Inheritance Patterns

Mitochondrial Disorders

Mendelian inheritance refers to the transmission of genes encoded by DNA contained in the nuclear chromosomes. In addition, each mitochondrion contains several copies of a small circular chromosome. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is 16.5 kb and encodes transfer and ribosomal RNAs and 13 proteins that are components of the respiratory chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. The mitochondrial genome does not recombine and is inherited through the maternal line because sperm does not contribute significant cytoplasmic components to the zygote. A noncoding region of the mitochondrial chromosome, referred to as D-loop, is highly polymorphic. This property, together with the absence of mtDNA recombination, makes it a valuable tool for studies tracing human migration and evolution, and it is also used for specific forensic applications.

Inherited mitochondrial disorders are transmitted in a matrilineal fashion; all children from an affected mother will inherit the disease, but it will not be transmitted from an affected father to his children (Fig. 61-11D). Alterations in the mtDNA affecting enzymes required for oxidative phosphorylation lead to reduction of ATP supply, generation of free radicals, and induction of apoptosis. Several syndromic disorders arising from mutations in the mitochondrial genome are known in humans and they affect both protein-coding and tRNA genes (Tables 61-1 and 61-5). The broad clinical spectrum often involves (cardio)myopathies and encephalopathies because of the high dependence of these tissues on oxidative phosphorylation. The age of onset and the clinical course are highly variable because of the unusual mechanisms of mtDNA transmission, which replicates independently from nuclear DNA. During cell replication, the proportion of wild-type and mutant mitochondria can drift among different cells and tissues. The resulting heterogeneity in the proportion of mitochondria with and without a mutation is referred to as heteroplasmia and underlies the phenotypic variability that is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases.

Acquired somatic mutations in mitochondria are thought to be involved in several age-dependent degenerative disorders affecting predominantly muscle and the peripheral and central nervous system (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). Establishing that an mtDNA alteration is causal for a clinical phenotype is challenging because of the high degree of polymorphism in mtDNA and the phenotypic variability characteristic of these disorders. Certain pharmacologic treatments may have an impact on mitochondria and/or their function. For example, treatment with the antiretroviral compound azidothymidine (AZT) causes an acquired mitochondrial myopathy through depletion of muscular mtDNA.

Mosaicism

Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more genetically distinct cell lines in the tissues of an individual. It results from a mutation that occurs during embryonic, fetal, or extrauterine development. The developmental stage at which the mutation arises will determine whether germ cells and/or somatic cells are involved. Chromosomal mosaicism results from nondisjunction at an early embryonic mitotic division, leading to the persistence of more than one cell line, as exemplified by some patients with Turner's syndrome (Chap. 349). Somatic mosaicism is characterized by a patchy distribution of genetically altered somatic cells. The McCune-Albright syndrome, for example, is caused by activating mutations in the stimulatory G protein  (Gs) that occur early in development (Chap. 353). The clinical phenotype varies depending on the tissue distribution of the mutation; manifestations include ovarian cysts that secrete sex steroids and cause precocious puberty, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, caf谷-au-lait skin pigmentation, growth hormone每secreting pituitary adenomas, and hypersecreting autonomous thyroid nodules (Chap. 347).

X-Inactivation, Imprinting, and Uniparental Disomy

According to traditional Mendelian principles, the parental origin of a mutant gene is irrelevant for the expression of the phenotype. There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X-chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation also occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes. This phenomenon, referred to as genomic imprinting, leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman's syndrome (Chap. 62). Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Deletions of the paternal copy of the Prader-Willi locus located on the short arm of chromosome 15 result in a contiguous gene syndrome involving missing paternal copies of the necdin and SNRPN genes, among others. In contrast, patients with Angelman's syndrome, characterized by mental retardation, seizures, ataxia, and hypotonia, have deletions involving the maternal copy of this region on chromosome 15. These two syndromes may also result from uniparental disomy. In this case, the syndromes are not caused by deletions on chromosome 15 but by the inheritance of either two maternal chromosomes (Prader-Willi syndrome) or two paternal chromosomes (Angelman's syndrome).

Imprinting and the related phenomenon of allelic exclusion may be more common than currently documented, as it is difficult to examine levels of mRNA expression from the maternal and paternal alleles in specific tissues or in individual cells. Genomic imprinting, or uniparental disomy, is involved in the pathogenesis of several other disorders and malignancies (Chap. 62). For example, hydatidiform moles contain a normal number of diploid chromosomes, but they are all of paternal origin. The opposite situation occurs in ovarian teratomata, with 46 chromosomes of maternal origin. Expression of the imprinted gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is involved in the pathogenesis of the cancer-predisposing Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (Chap. 83). These children show somatic overgrowth with organomegalies and hemihypertrophy, and they have an increased risk of embryonal malignancies such as Wilms' tumor. Normally, only the paternally derived copy of the IGF-II gene is active and the maternal copy is inactive. Imprinting of the IGF-II gene is regulated by H19, which encodes an RNA transcript that is not translated into protein. Disruption or lack of H19 methylation leads to a relaxation of IGF-II imprinting and expression of both alleles.

Meiotically and mitotically heritable changes in gene expression not associated with DNA sequence alterations are referred to as epigenetic effects. These changes involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA-mediated silencing, resulting in gene repression without a change in the coding sequence. Epigenetic alterations are increasingly recognized to play a role in human diseases such as cancer, mental retardation, hematologic disorders, and possibly in aging. For example, de novo methylation of CpG islands, regions of >500 bp in size with a GC content >55% in promoter regions that are normally unmethylated, is a hallmark of human cancers. Inhibitors of enzymes controlling epigenetic modifications such as histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases reverse gene silencing and represent a promising new group of antineoplastic agents.

Somatic Mutations

Cancer can be defined as a genetic disease at the cellular level (Chap. 83). Cancers are monoclonal in origin, indicating that they have arisen from a single precursor cell with one or several mutations in genes controlling growth (proliferation or apoptosis) and/or differentiation. These acquired somatic mutations are restricted to the tumor and its metastases and are not found in the surrounding normal tissue. The molecular alterations include dominant gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes, recessive loss-of-function mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and DNA repair genes, gene amplification, and chromosome rearrangements. Rarely, a single mutation in certain genes may be sufficient to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. In most cancers, however, the development of a malignant phenotype requires several genetic alterations for the gradual progression from a normal cell to a cancerous cell, a phenomenon termed multistep carcinogenesis (Chaps. 83 and 84). Genomewide analyses of cancers using deep sequencing often reveal somatic rearrangements and mutations in multiple genes. Most human tumors express telomerase, an enzyme formed of a protein and an RNA component, which adds telomere repeats at the ends of chromosomes during replication. This mechanism impedes shortening of the telomeres, which is associated with senescence in normal cells, and is associated with enhanced replicative capacity in cancer cells. Telomerase inhibitors may provide a novel strategy for treating advanced human cancers.

In many cancer syndromes, there is an inherited predisposition to tumor formation. In these instances, a germline mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion inactivating one allele of an autosomal tumor-suppressor gene. If the second allele is inactivated by a somatic mutation or by epigenetic silencing in a given cell, this will lead to neoplastic growth (Knudson two-hit model). Thus, the defective allele in the germline is transmitted in a dominant mode, though tumorigenesis results from a biallelic loss of the tumor-suppressor gene in an affected tissue. The classic example to illustrate this phenomenon is retinoblastoma, which can occur as a sporadic or hereditary tumor. In sporadic retinoblastoma, both copies of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene are inactivated through two somatic events. In hereditary retinoblastoma, one mutated or deleted RB allele is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and the second allele is inactivated by a subsequent somatic mutation. This two-hit model applies to other inherited cancer syndromes such as MEN-1 (Chap. 351) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (Chap. 379).

Nucleotide Repeat Expansion Disorders

Several diseases are associated with an increase in the number of nucleotide repeats above a certain threshold (Table 61-6). The repeats are sometimes located within the coding region of the genes, as in Huntington's disease or the X-linked form of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's syndrome). In other instances, the repeats probably alter gene regulatory sequences. If an expansion is present, the DNA fragment is unstable and tends to expand further during cell division. The length of the nucleotide repeat often correlates with the severity of the disease. When repeat length increases from one generation to the next, disease manifestations may worsen or be observed at an earlier age; this phenomenon is referred to as anticipation. In Huntington's disease, for example, there is a correlation between age of onset and length of the triplet codon expansion (Chap. 366). Anticipation has also been documented in other diseases caused by dynamic mutations in trinucleotide repeats (Table 61-6). The repeat number may also vary in a tissue-specific manner. In myotonic dystrophy, the CTG repeat may be tenfold greater in muscle tissue than in lymphocytes (Chap. 387).

Complex Genetic Disorders

The expression of many common diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, psychiatric disorders, and certain cancers is determined by a combination of genetic background, environmental factors, and lifestyle. A trait is called polygenic if multiple genes contribute to the phenotype or multifactorial if multiple genes are assumed to interact with environmental factors. Genetic models for these complex traits need to account for genetic heterogeneity and interactions with other genes and the environment. Complex genetic traits may be influenced by modifying genes that are not linked to the main gene involved in the pathogenesis of the trait. This type of gene-gene interaction, or epistasis, plays an important role in polygenic traits that require the simultaneous presence of variations in multiple genes to result in a pathologic phenotype.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus provides a paradigm for considering a multifactorial disorder, as genetic, nutritional, and lifestyle factors are intimately interrelated in disease pathogenesis (Table 61-7) (Chap. 344). The identification of genetic variations and environmental factors that either predispose to or protect against disease is essential for predicting disease risk, designing preventive strategies, and developing novel therapeutic approaches. The study of rare monogenic diseases may provide insight into some of genetic and molecular mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of complex diseases. For example, the identification of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) in maturity-onset of diabetes type 4 defined it as a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2 (Tables 61-2 and 61-7). Genome scans have identified various loci that may be associated with susceptibility to development of diabetes mellitus in certain populations. Efforts to identify susceptibility genes require very large sample sizes, and positive results may depend on ethnicity, ascertainment criteria, and statistical analysis. Association studies analyzing the potential influence of (biologically functional) SNPs and SNP haplotypes on a particular phenotype are providing new insights into the genes involved in the pathogenesis of these common disorders. Large variants [(micro)deletions, duplications, and inversions] present in the human population also contribute to the pathogenesis of complex disorders, but their contributions remain poorly understood.

Linkage and Association Studies

There are two primary strategies for mapping genes that cause or increase susceptibility to human disease: (1) classic linkage can be performed based on a known genetic model or, when the model is unknown, by studying pairs of affected relatives; or (2) disease genes can be mapped using allelic association studies (Table 61-8).

Genetic Linkage

Genetic linkage refers to the fact that genes are physically connected, or linked, to one another along the chromosomes. Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage: (1) when two genes are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together, unless a recombination event separates them (Figs. 61-3 and 61-7); and (2) the odds of a crossover, or recombination event, between two linked genes is proportional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are farther apart are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. The detection of chromosomal loci that segregate with a disease by linkage can be used to identify the gene responsible for the disease (positional cloning) and to predict the odds of disease gene transmission in genetic counseling.

Polymorphisms are essential for linkage studies because they provide a means to distinguish the maternal and paternal chromosomes in an individual. On average, 1 out of every 1000 bp varies from one person to the next. Although this degree of variation seems low (99.9% identical), it means that >3 million sequence differences exist between any two unrelated individuals and the probability that the sequence at such loci will differ on the two homologous chromosomes is high (often >70每90%). These sequence variations include variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), short tandem repeats (STRs), and SNPs. Most STRs, also called polymorphic microsatellite markers, consist of di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide repeats that can be measured readily using PCR (Fig. 61-12). Characterization of SNPs, using DNA chips or beads, permit comprehensive analyses of genetic variation, linkage, and association studies. Although these sequence variations usually have no apparent functional consequences, they provide much of the basis for variation in genetic traits.

Figure 61-12

 
 
 
CAG repeat length and linkage analysis in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. Upper panel. Detection of different alleles using polymorphic microsatellite markers. The example depicts a CAG trinucleotide repeat. PCR with primers flanking the polymorphic region results in products of variable length, depending on the number of CAG repeats. After characterization of the alleles in the parents, transmission of the paternal and maternal alleles can be determined. Lower panel. Genotype analysis using microsatellite markers in a family with MEN-1. Two microsatellite markers, A and B, are located in close proximity to the MEN1 gene on chromosome 11q13. For each individual, the A and B alleles have been determined. Based on this analysis, the genotype A3,B4 is linked to the disease because it occurs in the two affected individuals I-1 and II-2 but not in unaffected siblings. Because the disease allele is linked to A3,B4 within the affected family, it is likely that the individual III-1 is a carrier of the mutated MEN1 gene. Although III-5 also has the A3,B4 genotype, she has inherited the allele from her unaffected father (II-4), who is not related to the original family. The A3,B4 genotype is only associated with MEN-1 in the original family, but not in the general population. Therefore, individual III-5 is not at risk for developing the disease.
 
 

In order to identify a chromosomal locus that segregates with a disease, it is necessary to characterize polymorphic DNA markers from affected and unaffected individuals of one or several pedigrees. One can then assess whether certain marker alleles cosegregate with the disease. Markers that are closest to the disease gene are less likely to undergo recombination events and therefore receive a higher linkage score. Linkage is expressed as a lod (logarithm of odds) score'the ratio of the probability that the disease and marker loci are linked rather than unlinked. Lod scores of +3 (1000:1) are generally accepted as supporting linkage, whereas a score of 每2 is consistent with the absence of linkage.

An example of the use of linkage analysis is shown in Fig. 61-12. In this case, the gene for the autosomal dominant disorder MEN-1 is known to be located on chromosome 11q13. Using positional cloning, the MEN1 gene was identified and shown to encode menin, a tumor suppressor. Affected individuals inherit a mutant form of the MEN1 gene, predisposing them to certain types of tumors (parathyroid, pituitary, pancreatic islet) (Chap. 351). In the tissues that develop a tumor, a "second hit" occurs in the normal copy of the MEN1 gene. This somatic mutation may be a point mutation, a microdeletion, or loss of a chromosomal fragment (detected as loss of heterozygosity, LOH). Within a given family, linkage to the MEN1 gene locus can be assessed without necessarily knowing the specific mutation in the MEN1 gene. Using polymorphic STRs that are close to the MEN1 gene, one can assess transmission of the different MEN1 alleles and compare this pattern to development of the disorder to determine which allele is associated with risk of MEN-1. In the pedigree shown, the affected grandfather in generation I carries alleles 3 and 4 on the chromosome with the mutated MEN1 gene and alleles 2 and 2 on his other chromosome 11. Consistent with linkage of the 3/4 genotype to the MEN1 locus, his son in generation II is affected, whereas his daughter (who inherits the 2/2 genotype from her father) is unaffected. In the third generation, transmission of the 3/4 genotype indicates risk of developing MEN-1, assuming that no genetic recombination between the 3/4 alleles and the MEN1 gene has occurred. After a specific mutation in the MEN1 gene is identified within a family, it is possible to track transmission of the mutation itself, thereby eliminating uncertainty caused by recombination.

Allelic Association, Linkage Disequilibrium, and Haplotypes

Allelic association refers to a situation in which the frequency of an allele is significantly increased or decreased in individuals affected by a particular disease in comparison to controls. Linkage and association differ in several aspects. Genetic linkage is demonstrable in families or sibships. Association studies, on the other hand, compare a population of affected individuals with a control population. Association studies can be performed as case-control studies that include unrelated affected individuals and matched controls, or as family-based studies that compare the frequencies of alleles transmitted or not transmitted to affected children.

Allelic association studies are particularly useful for identifying susceptibility genes in complex diseases. When alleles at two loci occur more frequently in combination than would be predicted (based on known allele frequencies and recombination fractions), they are said to be in linkage disequilibrium. Evidence for linkage disequilibrium can be helpful in mapping disease genes because it suggests that the two loci are tightly linked.

Detecting the genetic factors contributing to the pathogenesis of common complex disorders remains a great challenge. In many instances, these are low-penetrancealleles (i.e., variations that individually only have a subtle effect on disease development, and they can only be identified by unbiased GWAS). Most variants are in noncoding or regulatory sequences but do not alter protein structure. The analysis of complex disorders is further complicated by ethnic differences in disease prevalence, differences in allele frequencies in known susceptibility genes among different populations, locus and allelic heterogeneity, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and the possibility of phenocopies. The data generated by the HapMap Project are greatly facilitating GWAS for the characterization of complex disorders. Adjacent SNPs are inherited together as blocks, and these blocks can be identified by genotyping selected marker SNPs, so-called Tag SNPs, thereby reducing cost and workload (Fig. 61-8). The availability of this information permits the characterization of a limited number of SNPs to identify the set of haplotypes present in an individual (e.g., in cases and controls). This, in turn, permits GWAS by searching for associations of certain haplotypes with a disease phenotype of interest, an essential step for unraveling the genetic factors contributing to complex disorders.

Population Genetics

In population genetics, the focus changes from alterations in an individual's genome to the distribution pattern of different genotypes in the population. In a case where there are only two alleles, A and a, the frequency of the genotypes will be p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1, with p2 corresponding to the frequency of AA, 2pq to the frequency of Aa, and q2 to aa. When the frequency of an allele is known, the frequency of the genotype can be calculated. Alternatively, one can determine an allele frequency, if the genotype frequency has been determined.

Allele frequencies vary among ethnic groups and geographic regions. For example, heterozygous mutations in the CFTR gene are relatively common in populations of European origin but are rare in the African population. Allele frequencies may vary because certain allelic variants confer a selective advantage. For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell mutation, which is particularly common in West Africa, are more resistant to malarial infection because the erythrocytes of heterozygotes provide a less favorable environment for Plasmodium parasites. Though homozygosity for the sickle cell gene is associated with severe anemia and sickle crises (Chap. 104), heterozygotes have a higher probability of survival because of the reduced morbidity and mortality from malaria; this phenomenon has led to an increased frequency of the mutant allele. Recessive conditions are more prevalent in geographically isolated populations because of the more restricted gene pool.

Approach to the Patient: Inherited Disorders

For the practicing clinician, the family history remains an essential step in recognizing the possibility of a hereditary component. When taking the history, it is useful to draw a detailed pedigree of the first-degree relatives (e.g., parents, siblings, and children), since they share 50% of genes with the patient. Standard symbols for pedigrees are depicted in Fig. 61-9. The family history should include information about ethnic background, age, health status, and (infant) deaths. Next, the physician should explore whether there is a family history of the same or related illnesses to the current problem. An inquiry focused on commonly occurring disorders such as cancers, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus should follow. Because of the possibility of age-dependent expressivity and penetrance, the family history will need intermittent updating. If the findings suggest a genetic disorder, the clinician will have to assess whether some of the patient's relatives may be at risk of carrying or transmitting the disease. In this circumstance, it is useful to confirm and extend the pedigree based on input from several family members. This information may form the basis for carrier detection, genetic counseling, early intervention, and prevention of a disease in relatives of the index patient (Chap. 63).

In instances where a diagnosis at the molecular level may be relevant, the physician will have to identify an appropriate laboratory that can perform the test. Genetic testing is available for a rapidly growing number of monogenic disorders through commercial laboratories. For uncommon disorders, the test may only be performed in a specialized research laboratory. Approved laboratories offering testing for inherited disorders can be identified in continuously updated on-line resources (GeneTests; Table 61-1). If genetic testing is considered, the patient and the family should be informed about the potential implications of positive results, including psychological distress and the possibility of discrimination. The patient or caretakers should be informed about the meaning of a negative result, technical limitations, and the possibility of false-negative and inconclusive results. For these reasons, genetic testing should only be performed after obtaining informed consent. Published ethical guidelines address the specific aspects that should be considered when testing children and adolescents. Genetic testing should usually be limited to situations in which the results may have an impact on the medical management.

Identifying the Disease-Causing Gene

Genomic medicine aims to enhance the quality of medical care through the use of genotypic analysis (DNA testing) to identify genetic predisposition to disease, to select more specific pharmacotherapy, and to design individualized medical care based on genotype. Genotype can be deduced by analysis of protein (e.g., hemoglobin, apoprotein E), mRNA, or DNA. However, technologic advances have made DNA analysis particularly useful because it can be readily applied.

DNA testing is performed by mutational analysis or linkage studies in individuals at risk for a genetic disorder known to be present in a family. Mass screening programs require tests of high sensitivity and specificity to be cost effective. Prerequisites for the success of genetic screening programs include the following: that the disorder is potentially serious; that it can be influenced at a presymptomatic stage by changes in behavior, diet, and/or pharmaceutical manipulations; and that the screening does not result in any harm or discrimination. Screening in Jewish populations for the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative storage disease Tay-Sachs has reduced the number of affected individuals. In contrast, screening for sickle cell trait/disease in African Americans has led to unanticipated problems of discrimination by health insurers and employers. Mass screening programs harbor additional potential problems. For example, screening for the most common genetic alteration in cystic fibrosis, the F508 mutation with a frequency of 70% in northern Europe is feasible and seems to be effective. One has to keep in mind, however, that there is pronounced allelic heterogeneity and that the disease can be caused by >1700 other mutations. The search for these less common mutations would substantially increase costs but not the effectiveness of the screening program as a whole. Next-generation genome sequencing will permit comprehensive and cost-effective mutational analyses after selective enrichment of candidate genes. For example, tests that sequence all the common genes causing hereditary deafness are already commercially available. Occupational screening programs aim to detect individuals with increased risk for certain professional activities (e.g., 1 antitrypsin deficiency and smoke or dust exposure).

Mutational Analyses

DNA sequence analysis is now widely used as a diagnostic tool and has significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy. It is used for determining carrier status and for prenatal testing in monogenic disorders (Chap. 63). Numerous techniques are available for the detection of mutations (Table 61-9). In a very broad sense, one can distinguish between techniques that allow for screening for the absence or presence of known mutations (screening mode) or techniques that definitively characterize mutations. Analyses of large alterations in the genome are possible using classic methods such as cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and Southern blotting (Chap. 62), as well as more sensitive novel techniques that search for multiple single exon deletions or duplications.

Next-generation DNA sequencing Sequencing of large contiguous genomic regions, exome of single or all chromosomes. Deep sequencing for detection of mutations and SNPs. Sequencing of whole genomes of microorganisms 
Microarrays Hybridization of PCR products to wild-type or mutated oligonucleotides Point mutations, small deletions and insertions

Genotyping of SNPs
 
 

 

More discrete sequence alterations rely heavily on the use of the PCR, which allows rapid gene amplification and analysis. Moreover, PCR makes it possible to perform genetic testing and mutational analysis with small amounts of DNA extracted from leukocytes or even from single cells, buccal cells, or hair roots. DNA sequencing can be performed directly on PCR products or on fragments cloned into plasmid vectors amplified in bacterial host cells. Sequencing of all exons of the genome or selected chromosomes, or sequencing of numerous candidate genes in a single run, is now possible with next-generation sequencing platforms.

The majority of traditional diagnostic methods were gel-based. Novel technologies for the analysis of mutations, genotyping, large-scale sequencing, and mRNA expression profiles are currently undergoing rapid evolution. DNA chip technologies allow hybridization of DNA or RNA to hundreds of thousands of probes simultaneously. Microarrays are being used clinically for mutational analysis of several human disease genes, as well as for the identification of viral or bacterial sequence variations. With advances in high-throughput DNA-sequencing technology, complete sequencing of the genome of an individual is expected to cost about $1000 within this decade. Although comprehensive sequencing of large genomic regions or multiple genes is already a reality, the subsequent bioinformatics analysis, assembly of sequence fragments, and comparative alignments remains a significant and commonly underestimated challenge for data handling.

The huge amount of data generated by massive parallel sequencing underscores the need for ongoing attention to ethical and legal concerns. They include, among others, issues related to consent, sequence interpretation, the discovery of incidental findings that are predictors of serious disorders, the ability to link the information to an individual despite the absence of any conventional personal identifier, and data storage.

A general algorithm for the approach to mutational analysis is outlined in Fig. 61-13. The importance of a detailed clinical phenotype cannot be overemphasized. This is the step where one should also consider the possibility of genetic heterogeneity and phenocopies. If obvious candidate genes are suggested by the phenotype, they can be analyzed directly. After identification of a mutation, it is essential to demonstrate that it segregates with the phenotype. The functional characterization of novel mutations is labor intensive and may require analyses in vitro or in transgenic models in order to document the relevance of the genetic alteration.

Approach to genetic disease.
 
 

Prenatal diagnosis of numerous genetic diseases in instances with a high risk for certain disorders is now possible by direct DNA analysis. Amniocentesis involves the removal of a small amount of amniotic fluid, usually at 16 weeks of gestation. Cells can be collected and submitted for karyotype analyses, FISH, and mutational analysis of selected genes. The main indications for amniocentesis include advanced maternal age (>35 years), an abnormal serum triple marker test (-fetoprotein,  human chorionic gonadotropin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, or unconjugated estriol), a family history of chromosomal abnormalities, or a Mendelian disorder amenable to genetic testing. Prenatal diagnosis can also be performed by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), in which a small amount of the chorion is removed by a transcervical or transabdominal biopsy. Chromosomes and DNA obtained from these cells can be submitted for cytogenetic and mutational analyses. CVS can be performed earlier in gestation (weeks 9每12) than amniocentesis, an aspect that may be of relevance when termination of pregnancy is a consideration. Later in pregnancy, beginning at about 18 weeks of gestation, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) permits collection of fetal blood for lymphocyte culture and analysis. In combination with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, it is even possible to perform genetic diagnoses in a single cell removed from the four- to eight-cell embryo or to analyze the first polar body from an oocyte. Preconceptual diagnosis thereby avoids therapeutic abortions but is extremely costly and labor intensive. Lastly, it has to be emphasized that excluding a specific disorder by any of these approaches is never equivalent to the assurance of having a normal child.

Mutations in certain cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 may identify individuals with an increased risk for the development of malignancies and result in risk-reducing interventions. The detection of mutations is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in leukemias and lymphomas. The demonstration of the presence or absence of mutations and polymorphisms is also relevant for the rapidly evolving field of pharmacogenomics, including the identification of differences in drug treatment response or metabolism as a function of genetic background. For example, the thiopurine drugs 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine are commonly used cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents. They are metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme with variable activity associated with genetic polymorphisms in 10% of whites and complete deficiency in about 1/300 individuals. Patients with intermediate or deficient TPMT activity are at risk for excessive toxicity, including fatal myelosuppression. Characterization of these polymorphisms allows mercaptopurine doses to be modified based on TPMT genotype. Pharmacogenomics may increasingly permit individualized drug therapy, improve drug effectiveness, reduce adverse side effects, and provide cost-effective pharmaceutical care.

Chromosome Disorders: Introduction

In humans, the normal diploid number of chromosomes is 46, consisting of 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes (numbered 1每22 in decreasing size) and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX in females and XY in males). The genome is estimated to contain approximately 25,000 genes. Even the smallest autosome contains between 200 and 300 genes. Not surprisingly, duplications or deletions of chromosomes, or even small chromosome segments, have profound consequences on normal gene expression, leading to severe developmental and physiologic abnormalities.

Deviations in number or structure of the 46 human chromosomes are astonishingly common, despite severe deleterious consequences. Chromosomal disorders occur in an estimated 10每25% of all pregnancies. They are the leading cause of fetal loss and, among pregnancies surviving to term, the leading known cause of birth defects and mental retardation.

In recent years, the practice of cytogenetics has shifted from conventional cytogenetic methodology to a union of cytogenetic and molecular techniques. Formerly the province of research laboratories, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic array analysis, and related molecular cytogenetic technologies have been incorporated into everyday practice in clinical laboratories. As a result, there is an increased appreciation of the importance of "subtle" constitutional cytogenetic abnormalities such as micro-deletions and imprinting disorders, as well as previously recognized translocations and disorders of chromosome number.
 
Visualizing Chromosomes

Conventional Cytogenetic Analysis

In theory, chromosome preparations can be obtained from any actively dividing tissue by causing the cells to arrest in metaphase, the stage of the cell cycle when chromosomes are maximally condensed. In practice, only a small number of tissues are used for routine chromosome analysis: amniocytes or chorionic villi for prenatal testing and blood, bone marrow, or skin fibroblasts for postnatal studies. Samples of blood, bone marrow, and chorionic villi can be processed using short-term culture techniques that yield results in 1每3 days. Analysis of other tissue types typically involves long-term cell culture, requiring 1每3 weeks of processing before cytogenetic analysis is possible.

Cells are isolated at metaphase or prometaphase and treated chemically or enzymatically to reveal chromosome "bands" (Fig. 62-1). Analysis of the number of chromosomes in the cell and the distribution of bands on individual chromosomes allow the identification of numerical or structural abnormalities. This strategy is useful for characterizing the normal chromosome complement and determining the incidence and types of major chromosome abnormalities.

Figure 62-1

 
 
 
A. An idealized human chromosome, showing the centromere (cen), long (q) and short (p) arms, and telomeres (tel). B. A G-banded human karyotype from a normal (46,XX) female.
 
 

Each human chromosome contains two specialized structures: a centromere and two telomeres. The centromere, or primary constriction, divides the chromosome into short (p) and long (q) arms and is responsible for the segregation of chromosomes during cell division. The telomeres, or chromosome ends, "cap" the p and q arms and are important for allowing DNA replication at the ends of the chromosomes. Prior to DNA replication, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid copy of the DNA double helix. After DNA replication and continuing until the time of cell division (including metaphase, when chromosomes are typically visualized), each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids (Fig. 62-1).

Molecular Cytogenetics

The introduction of FISH methodologies in the late 1980s revolutionized the field of cytogenetics. In principle, FISH is similar to other DNA每DNA hybridization methodologies. In most instances, the probe is labeled directly with a fluorochrome to allow detection. After the hybridization step, the specimen is counterstained and the preparations are visualized with a fluorescence microscope.

Types of Fish Probes

A variety of probes are available for use with FISH, including chromosome-specific paints (chromosome libraries), repetitive probes, and single-copy probes (Fig. 62-2). Chromosome libraries hybridize to sequences that span the entirety of the chromosome from which they are derived and, as a result, they can be used to "paint" individual chromosomes.

Figure 62-2

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Examples of different applications of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to human metaphase and interphase preparations. A, B. Aneuploidy detection: Interphase FISH using chromosome 13 (green) and chromosome 21 (red) unique sequence probes on interphase cells from direct amniotic fluid preparations. In "A" (a normal cell), two signals for both chromosomes 13 and 21 are seen; in "B," three signals for chromosome 21 are seen, indicating trisomy 21 in the fetus. C. Aneuploidy detection: Two-color FISH with telomere probes from the short arm (green) and the long arm (red) of chromosome 8. Hybridization with these probes shows fluorescence of both probes to three separate chromosomes, indicating the presence of trisomy 8 in this individual. D. Microdeletion detection: Two-color FISH is used to detect a microdeletion of chromosome 22 associated with velocardiofacial (VCF) syndrome. A probe for ARSA (a locus on the distal portion of chromosome 22, visualized as a green signal) is observed on both chromosomes 22. However, a probe for TUPLE1 (a locus within the VCF region of chromosome 22, visualized in red) hybridizes to only the normal chromosome. E. Characterization of structural rearrangements: M-FISH (multicolor FISH) is used to detect a complex chromosome rearrangement involving a translocation between chromosomes 6 and 16, as well as a translocation and inversion involving chromosomes 2 and 10.
 
 

Repetitive probes recognize amplified DNA sequences present in chromosomes. The most common are -satellite DNA probes that are complementary to DNA sequences found at the centromeric regions of all human chromosomes. A vast number of single-copy probes are now available as a result of the human genome project. These probes can be as small as 1 kb, though normally they are much larger and are packaged into fosmids (40 kb), or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) (100每200 kb). The most widely used probes are available commercially, including probes for specific rearrangements identified in a variety of cancers.

Applications of Fish and Array Technology

The majority of FISH applications involve hybridization of one or two probes of interest as an adjunctive procedure to conventional chromosomal banding techniques. In this regard, FISH can be utilized to identify specific chromosomes, characterize de novo duplications or deletions, and clarify subtle chromosomal rearrangements. Its greatest utilization in constitutional analysis, however, is in the detection of microdeletions (see below). In cancer cytogenetics, it is used extensively in the analysis of structural rearrangements. Though conventional cytogenetic studies can detect some microdeletions, initial detection and/or confirmation with FISH is essential. In fact, since appropriate FISH probes have become available, detection of microdeletion syndromes has increased significantly.

In addition to metaphase FISH, cells can be analyzed at a variety of stages. Interphase analysis, for example, can be used to make a rapid diagnosis in instances when metaphase chromosome preparations are not yet available (e.g., amniotic fluid interphase analysis). Interphase analysis also increases the number of cells available for examination, allows for investigation of nuclear organization, and provides results when cells do not progress to metaphase. One specialized type of interphase analysis involves the application of FISH to paraffin-embedded sections, thereby preserving the architecture of the tissue.

The use of interphase FISH has increased recently, especially for analyses of amniocentesis samples. These studies are performed on uncultured amniotic fluid, typically using DNA probes specific for the chromosomes most commonly identified in trisomies (chromosomes 13, 18, 21, and the X and Y). These studies can be performed rapidly (24每48 hours) and will ascertain about 60% of the abnormalities detected prenatally. Another area in which interphase analysis is routinely utilized is cancer cytogenetics (Chap. 83). Many site-specific translocations are associated with specific types of malignancies. For example, there are probes available for both the Abelson (Abl) oncogene and breakpoint cluster region (bcr) involved in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); these probes are labeled in red and green, respectively; the fusion of these genes in CML combines the fluorescent colors and appears as a yellow hybridization signal.

In addition to standard metaphase and interphase FISH analyses, a number of enhanced techniques have been developed for specific types of analysis, including multicolor FISH techniques, reverse painting, fiber FISH, and comparative genomic hybridization. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (m-FISH) techniques use combinatorially labeled probes that create a unique color for individual chromosomes. This technology is useful in the identification of unknown chromosome material (such as accessory marker chromosomes containing additional material) but has been most commonly used with the complex rearrangements seen in cancer specimens.

Fiber FISH is a technique in which chromosomes are mechanically stretched, using a variety of different methods. It provides a higher resolution of analysis than conventional FISH.

FISH comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a method that can be used only when DNA is available from a specimen of interest. The entire DNA specimen from the sample of interest is labeled in one color (e.g., green), and the normal control DNA specimen is indicated by another color (e.g., red). These are mixed in equal amounts and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes. The red-to-green ratio is analyzed by a computer program that determines where the DNA of interest may have gains or losses of material. Many of the FISH technologies are now being supplanted by the utilization of array analysis as described below.

The major advance for examining human chromosomes is an extension of the FISH CGH technologies. Specifically, the initial development of CGH arrays used protocols that are similar to standard FISH CGH, except that test DNA is hybridized to DNAs that are spread on arrays, rather than hybridized to normal chromosomes. These arrays are a natural outgrowth of both cytogenetic and FISH analysis, as they can provide a whole-genome analysis (as cytogenetic analysis provides), but at a higher resolution. There are several different types of arrays. CGH arrays utilize either BACs or oligonucleotides, whereas genotyping arrays (SNP arrays) utilize single nucleotide polymorphisms (Fig. 62-3). The resolution of these arrays can be up to 50 kb, far greater than for standard chromosome analysis. This technology has been used to study cryptic chromosomal imbalances in patients with mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies, as well as in prenatal diagnosis. It has also been used to detect microdeletions and microduplications in cancer and in previously unidentified genomic disorders. This technology is still in development, but it will ultimately be the initial method of study for constitutional abnormalities.

Indications for Cytogenetic Analysis

Primary indications for karyotypic analysis vary according to the developmental stage/age of the conceptus/individual under investigation. One especially important application is in prenatal diagnosis (particularly for pregnancies involving older women or women identified at increased risk by screening modalities), assaying for chromosomal abnormalities in either chorionic villi of first-trimester fetuses or amniotic fluid of second-trimester fetuses. Tissue specimens from spontaneously aborted fetuses or stillbirths can also be examined for chromosome abnormalities. Interphase cytogenetics (using FISH) is increasingly being used to study individual blastomeres of preimplantation embryos (with in vitro fertilization-derived pregnancies). This makes it possible to detect aneuploid or structurally unbalanced embryos or, in the case of sex-linked disorders, to identify male conceptuses; such embryos would not be used to initiate pregnancies.

Among infants and children, peripheral blood is examined, most often in individuals with specific phenotypic abnormalities. For example, karyotypic analysis can be used for the confirmation or exclusion of a specific chromosomal syndrome (e.g., trisomy 21); in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation with or without dysmorphic features; in cases of monogenic disorders associated with mental retardation and/or dysmorphic features; and with abnormalities of sexual differentiation and development. Additionally, the array analysis is being increasingly used in patients with autism.

In adults, peripheral blood can be examined in patients with infertility or recurrent miscarriages, since chromosome abnormalities can lead to meiotic arrest or to genetically unbalanced gametes. An important branch of cytogenetics is concerned with analyses of bone marrow, unstimulated peripheral blood, and lymph nodes of tumors, as chromosomal abnormalities are a common correlate of leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors (Chap. 83).

Cytogenetic Testing in Prenatal Diagnosis

The vast majority of prenatal diagnostic studies are performed to rule out a chromosomal abnormality, but cells may also be propagated for biochemical studies or molecular analyses of DNA. Three procedures are used to obtain samples for prenatal diagnosis: amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and fetal blood sampling. Amniocentesis is the most common procedure and is routinely performed at 15每17 weeks of gestation. On some occasions, early amniocentesis at 12每14 weeks is performed to expedite results, although less fluid is obtained at this time. Early amniocentesis carries a greater risk of spontaneous abortion or fetal injury but provides results at an earlier stage of pregnancy.

The vast majority of amniocenteses are performed in the context of advanced maternal age, the best-known correlate of trisomy (see below). Additional reasons for amniocentesis referral include an abnormal "triple- or quad-marker assay" and/or detection of ultrasound abnormalities. In the second trimester, levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), -fetoprotein, and unconjugated estriol (and, in the quad assay, inhibin) in the maternal serum are quantified and used to adjust the maternal age每predicted risk of a trisomy 21 or trisomy 18 fetus. More recently, first-trimester screening, involving the measurement of nuchal translucency, and the levels of PAPP-A and HCG are being used to identify women at increased risk. When integrated together, first- and second-trimester testing will identify approximately 93% of trisomy 21 pregnancies. Specific ultrasound abnormalities, when detected at midtrimester, can also be associated with chromosomal defects. When a nonspecific ultrasound abnormality is present, the estimated risk of a chromosomal defect is 16%. Associations of chromosomal abnormalities and specific types of abnormal ultrasound findings are listed in Table 62-1.

Congenital heart disease 30 8每40

CVS is the second most common procedure for genetic prenatal diagnosis. Because this procedure is routinely performed at about 10每12 weeks of gestation, it allows for an earlier detection of abnormalities and a safer pregnancy termination, if desired. CVS is a relatively safe procedure (spontaneous abortions, <0.5每1%). Because there is an increased association of limb defects when the procedure is performed earlier (<10 weeks of gestation), CVS is applicable during a narrow time frame of gestation. CVS involves the use of a catheter inserted transvaginally; 25 mg of villi are aspirated from the chorion frondosum (the fetal portion of the placenta). By adding colchicine directly to the rapidly dividing cytotrophoblasts, results can be obtained within 24每48 hours. Findings from these procedures should be confirmed by analyses of cultured mesenchymal cells, as they are more reliably derived from the fetus.

Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) is a method for obtaining fetal blood during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. PUBS is usually performed when ultrasound abnormalities are detected late in the second trimester. PUBS is also used when cytogenetic results from amniocentesis need clarification, such as in the detection of mosaicism.
 
Chromosome Abnormalities

Chromosomes in Cell Division

To understand the etiology of chromosome abnormalities, it is important to review the movement of chromosomes during cell division. In somatic tissues, chromosomes are replicated during the S-phase of the cell cycle, so that each replicated chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids. When the cell enters mitosis, each of the 46 chromosomes align on the metaphase plate, with the centromeres co-oriented toward opposite spindle poles (Fig. 62-4). At anaphase, the sister chromatids separate, with each of the daughter cells receiving one sister chromatid from each of the 46 chromosomes.

Figure 62-4

 
 
 
 
Chromosome segregation in meiosis. A. In meiosis I, each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes finds its "partner," or homologue, and exchanges genetic material (recombines) with it. At metaphase, each homologous pair aligns on the equatorial plate; at anaphase, each member of the homologous pair segregates from its partner. Thus, at the end of meiosis I, each daughter cell contains 23 chromosomes, with each chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids. B. In meiosis II, each chromosome aligns on the metaphase plate, and at anaphase, each of the two sister chromatids divides from the other. Thus, at the end of meiosis II, each daughter cell (e.g., the oocyte or spermatocyte) contains 23 chromosomes, with each chromosome consisting of one sister chromatid. In mitosis, the chromosomes behave exactly as they do in meiosis II, except that somatically dividing cells contain 46 chromosomes, not the 23 that are present in the meiosis II cell.
 
 

Chromosome segregation is more complicated in germ cell division, since the number of chromosomes must be reduced from 46 to 23 in the mature sperm and eggs. This is accomplished by two rounds of division'meiosis I and meiosis II (Fig. 62-4). In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material, then align on the metaphase plate, and finally separate from one another. Thus, by the end of meiosis I, only 23 of the original 46 chromosomes are represented in each of the two daughter cells. Meiosis II quickly follows meiosis I and is essentially a "haploid mitosis," involving separation of the sister chromatids in each of the 23 chromosomes.

Although the fundamentals of meiosis are the same in males and females, there are important distinctions, particularly in the timing of meiotic divisions. In males, meiosis begins with puberty and continues throughout the individual's lifetime. In females, meiosis begins prenatally, with oocytes proceeding through the first stages of meiosis I but arresting at mid-prophase. At the time of birth, the first meiotic division is suspended in oocytes. Only after ovulation many years later do oocytes complete meiosis I and proceed to the metaphase stage of meiosis II; if fertilized, the oocyte then completes the second meiotic division. Thus, in females, the first meiotic division takes at least 10每15 years and as many as 40每45 years to complete. Maternal age-related increases in the incidence of trisomy are likely the consequence of this protracted process of cell division.

Incidence and Types of Chromosome Abnormalities

Errors in meiosis, or in early cleavage divisions, occur with extraordinary frequency. At least 10每25% of all pregnancies, for example, involve chromosomally abnormal conceptions. A large proportion of these terminate in the earliest stages of pregnancy, many of which go unrecognized. Nevertheless, even among clinically recognized pregnancies, nearly 10% of fetuses are chromosomally unbalanced. For the three types of clinically recognized pregnancies〞spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and livebirths〞the frequencies of different chromosomal abnormalities are summarized in Table 62-2. The most common abnormalities are numerical, involving fetuses with additional (trisomy) or missing (monosomy) chromosomes, or those with one (triploidy) or two (tetraploidy) additional sets of chromosomes. Structural chromosome abnormalities are much less common, although several of the most important clinical chromosomal disorders involve structural rearrangements (see below).

By far the most common abnormality is trisomy, which is identified in 25% of spontaneous abortions and 0.3% of newborns. Trisomies for all chromosomes have now been identified in embryos or fetuses, but there is considerable variation in frequency for various chromosomes. For example, trisomy 16 is extraordinarily common, accounting for about one-third of all trisomies in spontaneous abortions, whereas trisomies 1, 5, 11, and 19 have been identified less often. Available evidence suggests two reasons for this variation: (1) some chromosomes (e.g., chromosome 16) are more likely to segregate abnormally or undergo nondisjunction during meiosis than are others; and (2) the potential for development varies widely among different trisomic conditions, with some being eliminated very early in gestation, others surviving to the time of clinical pregnancy recognition, and some (e.g., trisomies 13, 18, and 21 and sex chromosome trisomies) being compatible with survival to term.
 
Chromosomal Syndromes

While most chromosomally abnormal conceptions perish in utero, several conditions are compatible with survival to term. The best-characterized of these are numerical abnormalities, involving loss or gain of individual chromosomes, and abnormalities resulting from unbalanced translocations. FISH, array analysis, and other molecular studies have led to the identification of two "new" types of chromosome abnormalities, commonly referred to as microdeletion syndromes and imprinting syndromes.

Numerical Abnormalities

Virtually all types of numerical abnormalities are eliminated prenatally, so that only those involving small, gene-poor autosomes or the sex chromosomes are identified with any frequency among liveborns. Clinically, the most important of these is trisomy 21, the most frequent cause of Down syndrome. Depending on the maternal age structure of the population and the utilization of prenatal testing, the incidence of trisomy 21 ranges from 1/600 to 1/1000 livebirths, making it the most common chromosome abnormality in live-born individuals. Like most trisomies, the incidence of trisomy 21 is highly correlated with maternal age, increasing from about 1/1500 livebirths for women 20 years of age to 1/30 for women 45 years.

In addition to trisomy 21, only two other autosomal trisomies, 13 and 18, occur with any frequency in livebirths. Incidence rates for trisomies 13 and 18 in livebirths are 1/20,000 and 1/10,000, respectively. Unlike trisomy 21 that is associated with near-normal life expectancy, both trisomies 13 and 18 are associated with death in infancy, typically occurring during the first year of life.

Three sex chromosome trisomies〞the 47,XXX, 47,XXY (Klinefelter's syndrome), and 47,XYY conditions〞are quite common, with each occurring in about 1/2000 newborns. Of all the trisomic conditions, these three have the fewest phenotypic complications. In fact, with the exception of infertility in Klinefelter's syndrome (Chap. 349), it is likely that most individuals with such trisomic conditions would go undetected. The additional Y chromosome in the 47,XYY condition is small and contains only a few genes. Most Y-linked genes are involved in testicular development or spermatogenesis. Thus, dosage imbalance of Y-linked genes has relatively little effect on other developmental processes. The 47,XYY genotype is associated with increased height. Its role in antisocial behavior, postulated initially because of an increased prevalence among some penalized populations, is unclear.

For the 47,XXX and 47,XXY conditions, the situation is different〞the X chromosome contains >1000 genes, many of them essential for normal development. How, then, are 47,XXX and 47,XXY individuals spared from the catastrophic consequences of dosage imbalance? The answer lies in the biology of X chromosome gene expression. In normal females, one of the chromosomes undergoes X inactivation in somatic cells. The inactivation of the paternal or maternal X chromosome occurs randomly in each somatic cell and thereby serves as a mechanism of dosage compensation, ensuring that males and females have equal expression of most X-linked genes. The inactivation process occurs at the blastocyst stage of development; prior to this, both X chromosomes are active. In addition, not all X-linked genes are inactivated. Some genes on the X chromosome "escape" the inactivating mechanism and are expressed from both X chromosomes. In disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome, some genes may be expressed from both X chromosomes, resulting in its phenotypic features.

As a rule, monosomic conditions are incompatible with fetal development and, consequently, autosomal monosomies are only rarely identified in spontaneous abortions and are not found among live-born individuals. In fact, the only monosomy compatible with livebirth is the 45,X condition that causes Turner's syndrome. The 45,X chromosome constitution occurs with surprisingly high frequency, present in at least 1每2% of all pregnancies. More than 99% of all 45,X conceptions are spontaneously aborted. Thus, live-born individuals with a 45,X chromosome constitution represent a rare group of survivors. The 45,X phenotype is mild, presumably because the second copy of many X chromosomal genes is normally inactivated. Nonetheless, Turner's syndrome causes gonadal dysgenesis, resulting in infertility and failure to undergo secondary sexual development, along with a number of other phenotypic features (Chap. 349). Several other structural abnormalities of the X chromosome such as deletions, isochromosome X, or ring chromosomes can cause Turner's syndrome. Mosaicism, including 45,X/46,XX, 45,X/47,XXX, 45,X/46,XY, and others, also occurs (see below) and contributes to the phenotypic spectrum in Turner's syndrome.

Because numerical abnormalities originate in meiosis (Table 62-3), affected individuals have missing or extra chromosomes in all cells. In a small proportion of cases, a mitotic nondisjunctional event occurs at an early stage in an individual with an initially normal chromosome constitution. Alternatively, a "normalizing" mitotic nondisjunctional event may result in a normal chromosome complement in some cells of an embryo. In either case, the embryo is a mosaic, with some cells bearing a normal chromosome constitution and others an aneuploid number of chromosomes. The phenotypic consequences are difficult to predict because they depend on the timing of nondisjunction and the distribution of normal and abnormal cells in different tissues. Nevertheless, mosaicism may lead to clinical abnormalities indistinguishable from those of nonmosaic individuals (e.g., nearly 5% of all cases of Down syndrome involve individuals with mosaic trisomy 21, and about 15% of individuals with Turner's syndrome are mosaic for various sex chromosomal constitutions as described above).

The Origin and Etiology of Numerical Abnormalities

Over the past decade, a number of studies have used DNA polymorphisms to investigate the origin of different types of chromosome abnormalities (Fig. 62-5). The most thoroughly investigated types have been numerical abnormalities (Table 62-4). Sex chromosome monosomy usually results from loss of the paternal sex chromosome, regardless of whether the conception is liveborn or spontaneously aborted.

Analysis of a chromosome 21每specific DNA polymorphism demonstrates that the trisomic individual received two chromosomes 21 from his mother and one from his father; thus, the extra chromosome 21 resulted from an error in oogenesis. B. Inheritance of a chromosome 15每specific DNA polymorphism in an individual with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The affected individual has received two maternal, but no paternal, chromosomes 15; thus, the individual is said to have maternal uniparental disomy 15, a common cause of PWS.

Trisomies show remarkable variation in parental origin. For example, paternal nondisjunction is responsible for nearly 50% of 47,XXY but only 5每10% of cases of trisomies 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22; it is rarely, if ever, the source of the additional chromosome in trisomy 16. Similarly, there is considerable variability in the meiotic stage of origin. For example, all cases of trisomy 16 may be due to meiosis I errors, whereas for trisomy 21, one-third of cases are associated with meiosis II errors, and for trisomy 18, the majority of cases are apparently due to meiosis II nondisjunction. In spite of this variation in parental and meiotic origin, nondisjunction at maternal meiosis I appears to be the most common source of trisomy.

Maternal Age and Trisomy

The association between increasing maternal age and trisomy is the most important etiologic factor in congenital chromosomal disorders. Among women under the age of 25, 2% of all clinically recognized pregnancies are trisomic; by the age of 36, however, this figure increases to 10% and by the age of 42, to >33% (Fig. 62-6). This association between maternal age and trisomy is exerted without respect to race, geography, or socioeconomic factors and likely affects segregation of all chromosomes.

Figure 62-6

 
 
 
Estimated maternal age每adjusted rates of trisomy among all clinically recognized pregnancies (e.g., spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and livebirths). Among women in their forties, more than 25% of all pregnancies are estimated to involve a trisomic conception; the vast majority of these spontaneously abort, with only trisomies 13, 18, and 21 and sex chromosome trisomies surviving to term with any appreciable frequency.
 
 

Despite the importance of increasing age, little is known about the mechanism by which aging leads to abnormal chromosomal segregation. As noted above, it is thought to originate in maternal meiosis I owing to the protracted time to completion (often 40 years) in females, and recent studies suggest that it may be associated with alterations in meiotic crossing-over. In trisomy 21, for example, crossover patterns appear to be similarly abnormal in younger and older mothers of trisomic conceptions. Thus, it has been suggested that two distinct steps, or "hits," may be involved in maternal age-related nondisjunction. The first hit, which is age independent, involves the establishment of a "vulnerable" crossover configuration in the fetal oocyte; the second hit, which is age dependent, involves abnormal processing of the vulnerable bivalent structure at metaphase I. If this model is correct, it suggests that the nondisjunctional process is the same in younger and older women, but it occurs more frequently with aging, possibly because of age-dependent degradation of meiotic proteins.

Structural Chromosome Abnormalities

Structural rearrangements involve breakage and reunion of chromosomes. Although less common than numerical abnormalities, they present additional challenges from a genetic counseling standpoint. This is because structural abnormalities, unlike numerical abnormalities, can be present in "balanced" form in clinically normal individuals but transmitted in "unbalanced" form to progeny, thereby resulting in a hereditary form of chromosome abnormality.

Rearrangements may involve exchanges of material between different chromosomes (translocations) or loss, gain, or rearrangements of individual chromosomes (e.g., deletions, duplications, inversions, rings, or isochromosomes). Of particular clinical importance are translocations that involve two basic types: Robertsonian and reciprocal. Robertsonian rearrangements are a special class of translocation, in which the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) join together, generating a fusion chromosome that contains virtually all of the genetic material of the original two chromosomes. If the Robertsonian translocation is present in unbalanced form, a monosomic or trisomic conception ensues. For example, 3% of Down syndrome cases are attributable to unbalanced Robertsonian translocations, most often involving chromosomes 14 and 21. In this instance, the affected individual has 46 chromosomes, including one structurally normal chromosome 14, two structurally normal chromosomes 21, and one fusion 14/21 chromosome. This effect leads to a normal diploid dosage for chromosome 14 and to a triplication of chromosome 21, thus resulting in Down syndrome. Similarly, a small proportion of individuals with trisomy 13 syndrome are clinically affected because of an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 13.

Reciprocal translocations involve mutual exchanges between any two chromosomes. In this circumstance, the phenotypic consequences associated with unbalanced translocations depend on the location of the breakpoints that dictate the amount of material that has been "exchanged" between the two chromosomes. Because most reciprocal translocations involve unique sets of breakpoints, it is difficult to predict the phenotypic consequences in any one situation. In general, severity is determined by the amount of excess or missing chromosome material in individuals with unbalanced translocations.

In addition to rearrangements between chromosomes, there are several examples of intrachromosome structural abnormalities. The most common and deleterious of these involve loss of chromosome material due to deletions. The two best-characterized deletion syndromes, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and cri-du-chat syndrome, result from loss of relatively small chromosomal segments on chromosomes 4p and 5p, respectively. Nonetheless, each is associated with multiple congenital anomalies, developmental delays, profound retardation, and reduced lifespan.

Microdeletion Syndromes〞FISH

The term contiguous gene syndrome refers to genetic disorders that mimic a combination of single-gene disorders. They result from the deletion of a small number of tightly clustered genes. Because some are too small to be detected cytogenetically, they are termed microdeletions. The application of molecular techniques has led to the identification of at least 18 of these microdeletion syndromes (Table 62-4) that have been diagnosed using a directed FISH analysis. Some of the more common ones include the Wilms' tumor每aniridia complex (WAGR), Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), and velocardiofacial (VCF) syndrome. WAGR is characterized by mental retardation and involvement of multiple organs, including kidney (Wilms' tumor), eye (aniridia), and the genitourinary system. The cytogenetic abnormality involves a deletion of a part of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13), which typically is detectable on well-banded chromosome preparations. In MDS, a disorder characterized by mental retardation, dysmorphic facies, and lissencephaly, the deletion involves chromosome 17 (17p13.3). Using FISH, 17p deletions have been detected in >90% of patients with MDS as well as in 20% of cases of isolated lissencephaly.

Deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.21) are the most common microdeletions identified to date, present in 1/3000 newborns. VCF syndrome, the most commonly associated syndrome, consists of learning disabilities or mild mental retardation, palatal defects, a hypoplastic aloe nasi and long nose, and congenital heart defects (conotruncal defect). Some individuals with 22q11.21 deletion are more severely affected and present with DiGeorge syndrome that involves abnormalities in the development of the third and fourth branchial arches leading to thymic hypoplasia, parathyroid hypoplasia, and conotruncal heart defects. In 30% of these cases, a deletion at 22q11.21 can be detected with high-resolution banding; by combing conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and molecular detection techniques (i.e., Southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction analyses), these rates improve to >90%. Additional studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high frequency of 22q11.21 deletions in individuals with nonsyndromic conotruncal defects. Approximately 10% of individuals with a 22q11.21 deletion inherited it from a parent with a similar deletion.

Smith-Magenis syndrome involves a microdeletion localized to the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2). Affected individuals have mental retardation, dysmorphic facial features, delayed speech, peripheral neuropathy, and behavior abnormalities. Most of these deletions can be detected with cytogenetic analysis, although FISH is available to confirm these findings. In contrast, William syndrome, a chromosome 7 (7q11.23) microdeletion, cannot be diagnosed with standard or high-resolution analysis; it is only detectable utilizing FISH or other molecular methods. Williams' syndrome involves a deletion of the elastin gene and is characterized by mental retardation, dysmorphic features, a gregarious personality, premature aging, and congenital heart disease (usually supravalvular aortic stenosis).

In addition to microdeletion syndromes, there are several well-described microduplication syndromes, one of which is Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). This is a nerve conduction disease previously thought to be transmitted as a simple autosomal dominant disorder. Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that affected individuals are heterozygous for duplication of a small region of chromosome 17 (17p12). Although it is not yet clear why increased gene dosage would result in CMT1A, the inheritance pattern is explained by the fact that one-half of the offspring of affected individuals inherit the duplication-carrying chromosome.

Microdeletion Syndromes〞Array Analysis

All of the above-mentioned microdeletions and microduplications were initially identified clinically because of specific phenotypic features. After these were mapped to specific cytogenetic regions, FISH probes were developed to confirm the clinical diagnosis. With the advent of array analysis, new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes have been identified, often having less specific diagnostic criteria. These microdeletions and microduplications include changes in 16p11.2, 16p13.1, 15q13.3, 1q21.1, and are often ascertained because of autism. Often, the detected genetic changes are familial and parents do not always demonstrate any phenotypic abnormalities. Many of these are believed to be susceptibility genes that might increase an individual's risk for developing a disorder. Other changes such as a microdeletion involving 17q11.21, was not diagnosed before the advent of array analysis, and involves loss of the MAPTgene and is seen in patients with mental retardation, dysmorphic features, and hypopigmentation (Fig. 62-3).

Two microdeletion syndromes, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS), exhibit parent-of-origin, or "imprinting," effects. For many years, it has been known that cytogenetically detectable deletions of chromosome 15 occur in a proportion of patients with PWS, as well as in those with AS. This seemed curious, as the clinical manifestations of the two syndromes are very dissimilar, but the deletions appeared identical. PWS is characterized by obesity, hypogonadism, and mild to moderate mental retardation, whereas AS is associated with microcephaly, ataxic gait, seizures, inappropriate laughter, and severe mental retardation. New insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders has been provided by the recognition that parental origin of the deletion determines which phenotype ensues: If the deletion is paternal, the result is PWS, whereas if the deletion is maternal, the result is AS (Fig. 62-5B).

This scenario is complicated further by the recognition that not all individuals with PWS or AS carry the chromosome 15 deletion. For such individuals, the parental origin of the chromosome 15 region is again the important determinant. In PWS, for example, nondeletion patients invariably have two maternal and no paternal chromosomes 15 [maternal uniparental disomy (UPD)], whereas for some nondeletion AS patients the reverse is true (paternal UPD). This indicates that at least some genes on chromosome 15 are differently expressed, depending on which parent contributed the chromosome. Additionally, this means that normal fetal development requires the presence of one maternal and one paternal copy of chromosome 15.

Approximately 70% of PWS cases are due to paternal deletions of 15q11-q13, whereas 25% are due to maternal UPD, and about 5% are caused by mutations in a chromosome 15 imprinting center. In AS, 75% of cases are due to maternal deletions, and only 2% are due to paternal UPD. The remaining cases are presumably caused by imprinting mutations (5%), or mutations in the UBE3A gene, which is associated with AS. The UPD cases are mostly caused by meiotic nondisjunction resulting in trisomy 15, subsequently followed by a normalizing mitotic nondisjunction event ("trisomy rescue") resulting in two normal chromosomes 15, both from the same parent. UBE3A is the only maternally imprinted gene known in the critical region of chromosome 15. However, several paternally imprinted genes, or expressed-sequence tags (ESTs), have been identified, including ZNF127, IPW, SNRPN, SNURF, PAR1, and PAR5. Recently it has been postulated that a nontranscribed snoRNA (HBII-85), localized to the paternally imprinted region, may be responsible for the PWS phenotype.

Chromosomal regions that behave in the manner observed in PWS and AS are said to be imprinted. This phenomenon is involved in differential expression of certain genes on different chromosomes. Chromosome 11 is one of these with an imprinted region, since it is known that a small proportion of individuals with the Beckwith-Wiedemann overgrowth syndrome have two paternal but no maternal copies of this chromosome.
 
Acquired Chromosome Abnormalities in Cancer

In addition to the constitutional cytogenetic chromosomal abnormalities that are present at birth, somatic chromosomal changes can be acquired later in life and are often associated with malignant conditions. As with constitutional abnormalities, somatic changes can include the net loss of chromosomal material (due to a deletion or loss of a chromosome), net gain of material (duplication or gain of a chromosome), and relocation of DNA sequences (translocation). Cytogenetic changes have been particularly well studied in (1) leukemias, e.g., Philadelphia chromosome translocation in CML [t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)]; and (2) lymphomas, e.g., translocations of MYC in Burkitt's [t(8;14)(q24;q32)]. These and other translocations are useful for diagnosis, classification, and prognosis. Analyses of cytogenetic changes are also useful in certain solid tumors. For example, a complex karyotype with Wilms' tumor, diploidy in medulloblastoma, and Her-2/neu amplification in breast cancer are poor prognostic signs. For detailed discussion of cancer genetics, see Chap. 83.

Applications of Molecular Genetics in Clinical Medicine

The field of medical genetics has traditionally focused on chromosomal abnormalities (Chap. 62) and Mendelian disorders (Chap. 61). However, there is genetic susceptibility to many common adult-onset diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiac disorders, asthma, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, psychiatric disorders, and many forms of cancer. Genetic contributions to these common disorders involve more than the ultimate expression of the condition; these genes can also influence the severity of illness, progression of disease, and effect of treatment.

The primary care clinician is now faced with the role of recognizing and counseling patients at risk for a number of genetically influenced diseases. Among the greater than 20,000 genes in the human genome, it is estimated that each of us harbors several potentially deleterious mutations. Fortunately, many of these genetic alterations are recessive or clinically silent. An even greater number, however, represent genetic variants that alter disease susceptibility, course, or response to therapy.

Genetic medicine is changing the way diseases are classified, enhancing our understanding of pathophysiology, providing practical information concerning drug metabolism and therapeutic response, and allowing for individualized screening and health care management programs. In view of these changes, the physician must integrate personal medical history, family history, and diagnostic molecular testing into the overall care of individual patients and their families. Patients turn to their primary care providers for guidance about genetic disorders, even though they may also be seeing other specialists. The primary care provider has an important role in educating patients about the indications, benefits, risks, and limitations of genetic testing in the management of a number of diverse diseases. This is a difficult task, because scientific advances in genetic medicine are outpacing the translation of these discoveries into standards of clinical care.
 
Common Adult-Onset Genetic Disorders

Multifactorial Inheritance

The risk for many adult-onset disorders reflects the combined effects of genetic factors at multiple loci that may function independently or in combination with other genes or environmental factors. Our understanding of the genetic basis of these disorders is incomplete, despite the clear recognition of genetic susceptibility. In Type 2 diabetes mellitus, for example, the concordance rate in monozygotic twins ranges between 50 and 90%. Diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance occurs in 40% of siblings and in 30% of the offspring of an affected individual. Despite the fact that diabetes affects 5% of the population and exhibits a high degree of heritability, only a few genetic mutations (most of which are rare) that might account for the familial nature of the disease have been identified. They include certain mitochondrial DNA disorders (Chap. 61), mutations in a cascade of genes that control pancreatic islet cell development and function (HNF4, HNF1, IPF1, TCF7L2, glucokinase), insulin receptor mutations, and others (Chap. 344). In addition to these known genes, a large number of additional genetic loci that confer disease susceptibility have been identified. Superimposed on this genetic background are environmental or medical influences such as diet, exercise, pregnancy, and medications.

Identifying susceptibility genes associated with multifactorial adult-onset disorders is a formidable task. Nonetheless, a reasonable goal for these types of diseases is to identify genes that increase (or decrease) disease risk by a factor of two or more. For common diseases such as diabetes or heart disease, this level of risk has important implications for health. In much the same way that cholesterol is currently used as a biochemical marker of cardiovascular risk, we can anticipate the development of genetic panels with similar predictive power. The availability of DNA-microarray systems represents an important technology that makes large-scale testing feasible (Chap. 61). Whether to perform a genetic test for a particular inherited adult-onset disorder, such as hemochromatosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1, prolonged QT syndrome, or Huntington's disease, is a complex decision; it depends on the clinical features of the disorder, the desires of the patient and family, and whether the results of genetic testing will alter medical decision-making or treatment (see below).

Population Screening

Mass genetic screening programs require tests with high enough sensitivity and specificity to be cost-effective. An effective screening program should fulfill the following criteria: the tested disorder is prevalent and serious; it can be influenced presymptomatically through lifestyle changes, screening, medications, or other risk-reducing interventions; and identification of risk does not result in undue discrimination or harm. Screening individuals of Jewish descent for the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder Tay-Sachs disease has resulted in a dramatic decline in the incidence of this syndrome in the United States. On the other hand, screening for sickle cell disease or trait in the African-American population has sometimes resulted in insurance and employment discrimination.

Mass screening for complex genetic disorders can result in potential problems. For example, cystic fibrosis is most commonly associated with the F508 mutation. This variant accounts for 30每80% of mutant alleles, depending on the ethnic group. Nevertheless, cystic fibrosis is associated with pronounced genetic heterogeneity with more than 1000 disease-related mutations. The American College of Medical Genetics recommends a panel of 23 alleles, including the F508 allele, for routine carrier testing. Analysis for the less common cystic fibrosis每associated mutations would greatly impact the cost of testing without significantly influencing the effectiveness of mass screening. Nevertheless, the individual who carries one of the less common cystic fibrosis每associated alterations will not benefit if testing is limited to a routine panel.

Occupational health screening programs hold promise but also raise concerns about employment discrimination. These concerns were brought to light when it was discovered that a railroad company was testing its employees, without consent, for a rare genetic condition that results in susceptibility to carpal tunnel syndrome. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that the tests were unlawful under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Family History

When two or more first-degree relatives are affected with asthma, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, colon cancer, or melanoma, the relative risk ranges from two- to fivefold, underscoring the importance of family history for these prevalent disorders. Pending further advances in genetic testing, in most circumstances, the key to assessing the inherited risk for common adult-onset diseases rests in the collection and interpretation of a detailed personal and family medical history in conjunction with a directed physical examination. For example, a history of multiple family members with early-onset coronary artery disease, glucose intolerance, and hypertension should suggest increased risk for genetic, and perhaps environmental, predisposition to metabolic syndrome (Chap. 242). Individual patients with this family history should be monitored for the possible development of high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. They should be counseled about the importance of avoiding additional risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking.

Family history should be recorded in the form of a pedigree. At a minimum, pedigrees should convey health-related data on all first-degree relatives and selected second-degree relatives, including grandparents. When pedigrees appear to suggest an inherited disease, they should be extended to include additional family members. The determination of risk for an asymptomatic individual will vary depending on the size of the pedigree, the number of unaffected relatives, and the types of diagnoses, as well as the age of disease onset. For example, a woman with two first-degree relatives with breast cancer is at greater risk for a Mendelian disorder if she has a total of three female first-degree relatives than if she has a total of ten female first-degree relatives. Additional variables that should be documented in the pedigree include the presence or absence of nonhereditary risk factors among those affected with diseases and the finding of multiple diseases in an individual patient. For instance, a woman with a history of both colon cancer and endometrial cancer is at risk for Lynch syndrome regardless of her family history.

When assessing the personal and family history, the physician should be alert to a younger age of disease onset than is usually seen in the general population. A 30-year-old with acute myocardial infarction should be considered at risk for a hereditary trait, even if there is no family history of premature coronary artery disease (Chap. 241). The absence of the nonhereditary risk factors typically associated with a disease also raises the prospect of genetic causation. A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis, in the absence of known environmental or medical risk factors, suggests a hereditary thrombotic disorder (Chap. 117). The physical examination also may provide important clues about the risk for a specific inherited disorder. A patient presenting with xanthomas at a young age should prompt consideration of familial hypercholesterolemia. Some adult-onset disease-causing mutations are more prevalent in certain ethnic groups. For instance, >2% of the Ashkenazi population carry one of three specific mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The prevalence of the factor V Leiden allele ranges from 3 to 7% in Caucasians but is much lower in Africans or Asians.

Recall of family history is often inaccurate. This is especially so when the history is remote and families become more dispersed geographically. It can be helpful to ask patients to fill out family history forms before or after their visits, as this provides them with an opportunity to contact relatives. Ideally, this information should be embedded in electronic health records and updated intermittently. Attempts should be made to confirm the illnesses reported in the family history before making important and, in certain circumstances, irreversible management decisions. This process is often labor intensive and ideally involves interviews of additional family members or reviewing medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates.

Although many inherited disorders will be suggested by the clustering of relatives with the same or related conditions, it is important to note that disease penetrance is incomplete for most multifactorial genetic disorders. As a result, the pedigree obtained in such families may not exhibit a clear Mendelian inheritance pattern, as not all family members carrying the disease-associated alleles will manifest a clinical disorder. Furthermore, genes associated with some of these disorders often exhibit variable expression of disease. For example, the breast cancer每associated gene BRCA1 can predispose to several different malignancies in the same family, including cancers of the breast, ovary, and prostate (Chap. 83). For common diseases such as breast cancer, some family members without the disease-causing mutation may also develop breast cancer, representing another confounding variable in the pedigree analysis.

Some of the aforementioned features of the family history are illustrated in Fig. 63-1. In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset, as well as the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family, suggests the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear though〞without genetic testing〞whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the proband and her family, the most informative approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire. In the example shown, if the proband's father has the BRCA1 mutation, there is a 50:50 probability that the mutation was transmitted to her, and genetic testing can be used to establish the absence or presence of this alteration. In this same example, if a mutation is not detected in the cancer-affected cousin, testing would not be indicated for cancer-unaffected relatives.

A 36-year-old woman (arrow) seeks consultation because of her family history of cancer. The patient expresses concern that the multiple cancers in her relatives imply an inherited predisposition to develop cancer. The family history is recorded and records of the patient's relatives confirm the reported diagnoses.
 
 
 
Genetic Testing for Adult-Onset Disorders

A critical first step before initiating genetic testing is to ensure that the correct clinical diagnosis has been made, whether it is based on family history, characteristic physical findings, or biochemical testing. Careful clinical assessment can define the phenotype, thereby preventing unnecessary testing and directing testing toward the most probable candidate genes (Fig. 63-2). For patients identified by population-based screening (e.g., diabetes, hypercholesterolemia), testing might involve known candidate genes, or genome-wide linkage studies of the population could be used as part of a research study to identify susceptibility alleles. For patients with a strong family history (e.g., breast cancer, hemochromatosis), testing often includes known candidate genes, or traditional linkage analyses within pedigrees can identify candidate disease-causing genes. Once disease-related genes are known, mutational analyses can be performed after pretest genetic counseling (see below).

Figure 63-2

 
 
 
Approach to identifying a disease-causing gene.
 
 

Many disorders exhibit the feature of locus heterogeneity, which refers to the fact that mutations in different genes can cause phenotypically similar disorders. For example, osteogenesis imperfecta (Chap. 363), long QT syndrome (Chap. 233), muscular dystrophy (Chap. 387), homocystinuria (Chap. 364), retinitis pigmentosa (Chap. 28), and hereditary predisposition to colon cancer (Chap. 91) or breast cancer (Chap. 90) can each be caused by mutations in distinct genes. The pattern of disease transmission, disease risk, clinical course, and treatment may differ significantly, depending on the specific gene affected. In these cases, the choice of which genes to test is often determined by unique clinical and family history features, the relative prevalence of mutations in various genes, or test availability.

Methodologic Approaches to Genetic Testing

Genetic testing is performed in much the same way as other specialized laboratory tests. In the United States, genetic testing laboratories are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) approved to ensure that they meet quality and proficiency standards. A useful information source for various genetic tests is www.genetests.org.

DNA testing is most commonly performed by DNA sequence analysis for mutations, although genotype can also be deduced through the study of RNA or protein (e.g., apoprotein E, hemoglobin, immunohistochemistry). For example, immunohistochemical analysis of colorectal cancers for absence of expression of mismatch repair proteins has been proposed as a strategy for universal Lynch syndrome screening. The determination of DNA sequence alterations relies heavily on the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows rapid amplification and analysis of the gene of interest. In addition, PCR enables genetic testing on minimal amounts of DNA extracted from a wide range of tissue sources including leukocytes, mucosal epithelial cells, and archival tissues. Amplified DNA can be analyzed directly by DNA sequencing or it can be hybridized to DNA chips or blots to detect the presence of normal and altered DNA sequences. Direct DNA sequencing is increasingly used for prenatal diagnosis as well as for determination of hereditary disease susceptibility. Analyses of large alterations in the genome are possible using cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or Southern blotting (Chap. 62).

Protein truncation tests (PTTs) are used to detect mutations that result in the premature termination of a polypeptide occurring during protein synthesis. In this assay, the isolated complementary DNA (cDNA) is transcribed and translated in vitro, and the protein is analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The truncated (mutant) gene product is readily identified as its electrophoretic mobility differs from that of the normal protein. This test has been used most commonly for analyses of large genes with significant genetic heterogeneity such as the APC gene.

Like all laboratory analyses, there are limitations to the accuracy and interpretation of genetic tests. In addition to technical errors, genetic tests are sometimes designed to detect only the most common mutations. In this case, a negative result must be qualified by the possibility that the individual may have a mutation that is not included in the test. In addition, a negative result does not mean that there is not a mutation in some other gene that causes a similar inherited disorder. A negative result, in those at risk for the disorder, is typically classified as uninformative.

In addition to molecular testing for established disease, genetic testing for susceptibility to chronic disease is being increasingly integrated into the practice of medicine. In most cases, however, the discovery of disease-associated genes has greatly outpaced studies that assess the clinical utility of genetic testing. Until such evidence-based studies are available, predictive molecular testing must be approached with caution and should be offered only to patients who have been adequately counseled and have provided informed consent. In the majority of cases, genetic testing should be offered only to individuals with a suggestive personal or family medical history or in the context of a clinical trial.

Predictive genetic testing falls into two distinct categories. Presymptomatic testing applies to diseases where a specific genetic alteration is associated with a near 100% likelihood of developing disease. In contrast, predisposition testing predicts a risk for disease that is less than 100%. For example, presymptomatic testing is available for those at risk for Huntington's disease, whereas predisposition testing is considered for those at risk for hereditary breast cancer. It is important to note that, for the majority of adult-onset, multifactorial genetic disorders, testing is only predictive. Test results cannot reveal with confidence whether, when, or how the disease will manifest itself. For example, not everyone with the apolipoprotein E allele (4) will develop Alzheimer's disease, and individuals without this genetic marker can still develop the disorder (Chap. 371).

Molecular analysis is generally more informative if testing is initiated in a symptomatic family member because the identification of a mutation can direct the testing of other at-risk family members (whether they are symptomatic or not). In the absence of additional familial or environmental risk factors, individuals who test negative for the mutation found in the affected family member can be informed that they are at general population risk for that particular disease. Furthermore, they can be reassured that they are not at risk for passing the mutation on to their children. On the other hand, asymptomatic family members who test positive for the known mutation must be informed that they are at increased risk for disease development and for transmitting the alteration to their children.

Clinicians providing pretest counseling and education should assess the patient's ability to understand and cope with test results. Individuals who demonstrate signs and symptoms of emotional distress should have their psychosocial needs addressed before proceeding with molecular testing. Generally, genetic testing should not be offered at a time of personal crisis or acute illness within the family. Patients will derive more benefit from test results if they are emotionally able to comprehend and absorb the information. It is important to assess a patient's preconceived notions of their personal likelihood of disease in preparing pretest educational strategies. Often, patients harbor unwarranted fear or denial of their likelihood of genetic risk.

Genetic testing has the potential of affecting the way individual family members relate to one another, both negatively and positively. As a result, patients addressing the option of molecular testing must consider how test results might impact their relationships with relatives, partners, spouses, and friends. In families with a known genetic mutation, those who test positive must consider the impact of their carrier status on their present and future lifestyles; those who test negative may manifest survivor guilt. Family members are likely to differ in their emotional and social responses to the same information. Counseling should also address the potential consequences of test results on relationships with a spouse or child. Parents who are found to have a disease-associated mutation often express considerable anxiety and despair as they address the issue of risk to their children.

When a condition does not manifest until adulthood, clinicians will be faced with the question of whether at-risk children should be offered molecular testing and, if so, at what age. Although the matter is debated, several professional organizations have cautioned that genetic testing for adult-onset disorders should not be offered to children. Many of these conditions are not preventable; consequently, such information can pose significant psychosocial risk to the child. In addition, there is concern that testing during childhood violates a child's right to make an informed decision regarding testing upon reaching adulthood. On the other hand, testing should be offered in childhood for disorders that may manifest early in life, especially when management options are available. For example, children at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), associated with alterations in the APC gene, may develop polyps as early as their teens, and progression to an invasive cancer can occur by their twenties. Likewise, children at risk for MEN type 2, which is caused by mutations in the RET protooncogene, may develop medullary thyroid cancer early in childhood, and the issue of prophylactic thyroidectomy should be addressed with the parents of children with documented mutations (Chap. 351).

Informed Consent

When the issue of testing is addressed, patients should be strongly encouraged to involve other relatives in the decision-making process, because molecular diagnostics will likely have an impact on the entire family. Informed consent for molecular testing begins with detailed education and counseling (Fig. 63-3). The patient must fully understand the risks, benefits, and limitations of undergoing the analysis. Informed consent should include a written document, drafted clearly and concisely in a language and format that is comprehensible to the patient, who should be made aware of the disposition of test results. Informed consent should also include a discussion of the mechanics of testing. Most molecular testing for hereditary disease involves DNA-based analysis of peripheral blood. In the majority of circumstances, test results should be given only to the individual, in person, and preferably with a support person in the room.

Figure 63-3

 
 
 
Algorithm for genetic counseling in association with genetic testing.
 
 

Because molecular testing of an asymptomatic individual often allows prediction of future risk, the patient should understand any potential long-term medical, psychological, and social implications of this decision. In the United States, legislation affecting health insurance genetic discrimination has evolved through the Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act. It is important to explore with the patient the potential impact that test results may have on employment and future health as well as disability and life insurance coverage.

Patients should understand that alternatives to molecular analysis remain available if they decide not to proceed with this option. They should also be notified that testing is available in the future if they are not currently prepared to undergo analysis. The option of DNA banking should be presented so that samples are readily available for future use by family members, if needed.

Follow-Up Care after Testing

Depending on the nature of the genetic disorder, posttest interventions may include (1) cautious surveillance and appropriate health care screening, (2) specific medical interventions, (3) chemoprevention, (4) risk avoidance, and (5) referral to support services. For example, patients with known pathologic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are strongly encouraged to pursue risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and are offered intensive screening as well as the option of risk-reducing mastectomy. In addition, such women may be eligible for preventive treatment with tamoxifen or enrollment in a chemoprevention clinical trial. In contrast, those at known risk for Huntington's disease are offered continued follow-up and supportive services, including physical and occupational therapy, and social services or support groups, as indicated. Specific interventions will change as translational research continues to enhance our understanding of these genetic diseases and as more is learned about the functions of the gene products involved.

Individuals who test negative for a mutation in a disease-associated gene identified in an affected family member must be reminded that they may still be at risk for the disease. This is of particular importance for common diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, and coronary artery disease. For example, a woman who finds that she does not carry the disease-associated mutation in BRCA2 previously discovered in her family must be reminded that she still requires the same breast cancer screening recommended for the general population.
 
Genetic Counseling and Education

Genetic counseling should be distinguished from genetic testing and screening, even though genetic counselors are often involved in issues related to testing. Genetic counseling refers to a communication process that deals with human problems associated with the occurrence or risk of a genetic disorder in a family. Genetic risk assessment is complex and often involves elements of uncertainty. Counseling, therefore, includes genetic education as well as psychosocial counseling. Genetic counselors may be called upon by other health care professionals (or by individual patients and families) to address a broad range of issues directly and indirectly related to genetic disease (Table 63-1). The role of the genetic counselor includes the following:

Gather and document a detailed family history
Educate patients about general genetic principles related to disease risk, both for themselves and for others in their family
Assess and enhance the patient's ability to cope with the genetic information offered
Discuss how nongenetic factors may relate to the ultimate expression of disease
Address medical management issues
Assist in determining the role of genetic testing for the individual and family
Ensure that the patient is aware of the indications, process, risks, benefits, and limitations of the various genetic testing options
Assist the patient, family, and referring physician in the interpretation of the test results
Refer the patient and other at-risk family members for additional medical and support services, if necessary
Table 63-1 Indications for Genetic Counseling

The complexity of genetic counseling and the broad scope of genetic diseases have led to the development of specialized, multidisciplinary clinics designed to provide broad-based support and medical care for those at risk and their family members. Such specialty clinics are well established in the areas of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and are developing in other areas such as cardiology. The multidisciplinary teams are often composed of medical geneticists, specialist physicians, genetic counselors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and biomedical ethicists who work together to consider difficult diagnostic, treatment, and testing decisions. Such a format also provides primary care physicians with invaluable support and assistance as they follow and treat at-risk patients.

The approach to genetic counseling has important ethical, social, and financial implications. Philosophies related to genetic counseling vary widely by country and center. Counseling is generally offered in a nondirective manner, wherein patients learn to understand how their values factor into a particular medical decision. Nondirective counseling is particularly appropriate when there are no data demonstrating a clear benefit associated with a particular intervention or when an intervention is considered experimental. For example, nondirective genetic counseling is employed when a person is deciding whether to undergo genetic testing for Huntington's disease (Chap. 371). At this time, there is no clear benefit (in terms of medical outcome) to an at-risk individual undergoing genetic testing for this disease, because its course cannot be altered by therapeutic interventions. However, testing can have an important impact on this individual's perception of the future and his or her interpersonal relationships and plans for reproduction. Therefore, the decision to pursue testing rests on the individual's belief system and values. On the other hand, a more directive approach is appropriate when a condition can be treated. In a family with FAP, colon cancer screening and prophylactic colectomy should be recommended for known APC mutation carriers. The counselor and clinician following this family must ensure that the at-risk family members have access to the resources necessary to adhere to these recommendations.

Genetic education is central to an individual's ability to make an informed decision regarding testing options and treatment. Although genetic counselors represent one source of genetic education, other health care providers also need to contribute to patient education. Patients at risk for genetic disease should understand fundamental medical genetic principles and terminology relevant to their situation. This includes the concept of genes, how they are transmitted, and how they confer hereditary disease risk. An adequate knowledge of patterns of inheritance will allow patients to understand the probability of disease risk for themselves and other family members. It is also important to impart the concepts of disease penetrance and expression. For most complex adult-onset genetic disorders, asymptomatic patients should be advised that a positive test result does not always translate into future disease development. In addition, the role of nongenetic factors, such as environmental exposures, must be discussed in the context of multifactorial disease risk and disease prevention. Finally, patients should understand the natural history of the disease as well as the potential options for intervention, including screening, prevention, and〞in certain circumstances〞pharmacologic treatment or prophylactic surgery.
 
Therapeutic Interventions Based on Genetic Risk for Disease

Specific treatments are now available for an increasing number of genetic disorders, whether identified through population-based screening or directed testing (Table 63-2). Although the strategies for therapeutic interventions are best developed for childhood hereditary metabolic diseases, these principles have made their way into the diagnosis and management of adult-onset disorders. Hereditary hemochromatosis illustrates many of the issues raised by the availability of genetic screening in the adult population. For instance, hemochromatosis is relatively common (approximately 1 in 200 individuals of northern European descent are homozygous), and its complications are potentially preventable through phlebotomy (Chap. 357). The identification of the HFE gene, mutations of which are associated with this syndrome, has sparked interest in the use of DNA-based testing for presymptomatic diagnosis of the disorder. However, up to one-third of individuals who are homozygous for the HFE mutation do not have evidence of iron overload. Consequently, in the absence of a positive family history, current recommendations include phenotypic screening for evidence of iron overload followed by genetic testing. Whether genetic screening for hemochromatosis will someday be coupled to assessment of phenotypic expression awaits further studies. In contrast to the issue of population screening, it is important to test and counsel other family members when the diagnosis of hemochromatosis has been made in a proband. Testing allows the physician to exclude family members who are not at risk. It also permits presymptomatic detection of iron overload and the institution of treatment (phlebotomy) before the development of organ damage.

Preventive measures and therapeutic interventions are not restricted to metabolic disorders. Identification of familial forms of long QT syndrome, associated with ventricular arrhythmias, allows early electrocardiographic testing and the use of prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy, overdrive pacemakers, or defibrillators (Chap. 233). Individuals with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be screened by ultrasound, treated with beta blockers or other drugs, and counseled about the importance of avoiding strenuous exercise and dehydration (Chap. 238). Likewise, individuals with Marfan syndrome can be treated with beta blockers or ACE inhibitors and monitored for the development of aortic aneurysms (Chap. 248). Individuals with 1 antitrypsin deficiency can be strongly counseled to avoid cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental pulmonary and hepatotoxins. Various host genes influence the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases in humans, including HIV (Chap. 189). The factor V Leiden allele increases risk of thrombosis (Chap. 58). Approximately 3% of the worldwide population is heterozygous for this mutation. Moreover, it is found in up to 25% of patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Women who are heterozygous or homozygous for this allele should, therefore, avoid the use of oral contraceptives.

The field of pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genes that alter drug metabolism or confer susceptibility to toxic drug reactions. Pharmacogenomics permits individualized drug therapy, resulting in improved treatment outcomes, reduced toxicities, and more cost-effective pharmaceutical care. Examples include succinylcholine sensitivity, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency, malignant hyperthermia, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, the porphyrias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

As noted above, the identification of genes that increase the risk of specific types of neoplasia is rapidly changing the management of many cancers. Identifying family members with mutations that predispose to FAP or Lynch syndrome can lead to recommendations of early cancer screening or prophylactic surgery (Chap. 91). Similar principles apply to familial forms of melanoma; basal cell carcinoma; and cancers of the breast, ovary, and thyroid gland. It should be recognized, however, that most cancers harbor several distinct genetic abnormalities by the time they acquire invasive or metastatic potential (Chaps. 83 and 84). Consequently, the major impact of genetic testing in these cases is to allow more intensive management, including disease prevention and screening, as it remains very challenging to predict disease penetrance, expression, or clinical course.

Although genetic diagnosis of these and other disorders is still evolving in the clinical setting, predictive testing holds the promise of allowing earlier and more targeted interventions that can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. We can expect the availability of genetic tests to expand, including direct-to-consumer options. A critical challenge for physicians and other health care providers is to keep pace with these advances in genetic medicine and to implement testing judiciously.

Mitochondrial DNA and Heritable Traits and Diseases: Introduction

Mitochondria are cytoplasmic organelles whose major function is to generate ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic conditions. This process is mediated by the respiratory electron transport chain (ETC) multiprotein enzyme complexes I每V and the two electron carriers, coenzyme Q (CoQ) and cytochrome c. Other cellular processes to which mitochondria make a major contribution include apoptosis (programmed cell death), along with additional cell-type specific functions (Table e18-1). The efficiency of the mitochondrial ETC in ATP production is a major determinant of overall body energy balance and thermogenesis. In addition, mitochondria are the predominant source for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose rate of production also relates to the coupling of ATP production to oxygen consumption. In light of the centrality of oxidative phosphorylation to the normal activities of almost all cells, it is not surprising that mitochondrial dysfunction can affect almost any organ system (Fig. e18-1). Thus, physicians in many specialties may encounter patients with mitochondrial diseases and should be aware of the existence and characteristics of those diseases.

The integrated activity of an estimated 1500 gene products is required for normal mitochondrial biogenesis, function, and integrity. Most of these products are encoded by nuclear genes and thus follow the rules and patterns of nuclear genomic inheritance (Chap. 63). These nuclear-encoded proteins are synthesized in the cell cytoplasm and imported to their location of activity in mitochondria through a complex biochemical process. In addition, the mitochondria have their own genome, which consists of numerous copies (polyploidy) per mitochondrion of a circular, double-strand mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule consisting of a 16,569-nucleotide sequence. This mtDNA sequence contains a total of 37 genes, of which 13 encode mitochondrial protein components of the ETC. The remaining 22 tRNA- and 2 rRNA-encoding genes are dedicated to the process of translating the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. This dual genetic control of mitochondrial function results in unique and diagnostically challenging patterns of inheritance. This chapter focuses on heritable traits and diseases related to the mtDNA component of the dual genetic control of mitochondrial function. The reader is referred to Chaps. 63 and 387 for consideration of mitochondrial disease originating from mutations in the nuclear genome. These mutations include (1) nuclear genomic mutations that disrupt the integrity of the mitochondrial genome itself (mtDNA deletion and depletion states), (2) disorders due to mutations in nuclear genes that encode structural components or assembly factors of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes, and (3) mitochondrial disorders due to mutations in nuclear genes that encode proteins indirectly related to oxidative phosphorylation.
 
Mitochondrial DNA Structure and Function

As a result of its circular structure and extranuclear location, the replication and transcription mechanisms of mtDNA differ from the corresponding mechanisms in the nuclear genome, whose nucleosomal packaging and structure are more complex. Since each mitochondrion contains many copies of mtDNA and because the number of mitochondria can vary during the lifetime of each cell through the processes of fission, fusion, and mitochondrial biogenesis, mtDNA copy number is not directly coordinated with the cell cycle. Thus, vast differences in mtDNA copy number are observed between different cell types and tissues and during the lifetime of a cell. Another important feature of the mtDNA replication process is a greatly reduced stringency of proofreading and replication error correction, leading to a greater degree of sequence variation compared with the nuclear genome. This fidelity limitation is due to the presence of one replicase, polymerase , which is solely responsible for both DNA replication and repair in mitochondria. Some of these sequence variants are silent polymorphisms that do not have the potential for a phenotypic or pathogenic effect, whereas others may be considered pathogenic mutations.

With respect to transcription, initiation can occur on both strands and proceeds through the production of an intronless polycistronic precursor RNA that then is processed to produce the 13 individual mRNA and 24 individual tRNA and rRNA products. The 37 mtDNA genes account for fully 93% of the 16,569 nucleotides of the mtDNA in what is known as the coding region. The control region consists of ~1.1 kilobases (kb) of noncoding DNA that is thought to play a major role in replication and transcription initiation. The mutation rate is considerably higher in the control region, which contains a displacement, or D loop, which in turn contains two adjacent hypervariable regions (HVR-I and HVR-II) that give rise to large interindividual variability within the human population. Indeed, mtDNA sequence variants at both the coding and control regions are more highly partitioned across geographically defined populations than are sequence variants in other parts of the genome, and combinations of these sequence variants define phylogeographic mtDNA haplogroups and haplotypes. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that differences in these haplotypes are of medical significance in regard to predisposition to common diseases. The foregoing structural and functional features of mtDNA lead to the expectation that phenotypic inheritance and disease patterns for disorders related to mtDNA sequence variations and mutations should be quite different from the more familiar inheritance and disease patterns attributed to variation and mutation in nuclear DNA. Intensive research during the last two decades has confirmed that this is the case.

Maternal Inheritance and Lack of Recombination

In contrast to the homologous pair recombination that takes place in the nucleus, mtDNA molecules do not undergo recombination, and so mutational events represent the only source of mtDNA genetic diversification. Moreover, with very rare exceptions, it is only the maternal DNA that is transmitted to the offspring. The fertilized oocyte degrades mtDNA carried from the sperm in a complex process that involves the ubiquitin proteasome system. Thus, whereas mothers transmit their mtDNA to both their sons and their daughters, only the daughters are able to transmit the inherited mtDNA to future generations. Accordingly, mtDNA sequence variation and associated phenotypic traits and diseases are inherited exclusively along maternal lines.

As noted below, because of the complex relationship between mtDNA mutations and disease expression, sometimes this maternal inheritance is difficult to recognize at the clinical or pedigree level. However, evidence of paternal transmission almost certainly rules out an mtDNA genetic origin of phenotypic variation or disease; conversely, a disease affecting both sexes without evidence of paternal transmission strongly suggests a heritable mtDNA disorder (Fig. e18-2).

Multiple Copy Number (Polyploidy), Mitotic Segregation, and High Mutation Rate

Each aerobic cell in the body has multiple mitochondria, often numbering many hundreds or more in cells with extensive energy production requirements. Furthermore, the number of copies of mtDNA within each mitochondrion varies from several to hundreds; this is true of both somatic and germ cells, including oocytes in females. In the case of somatic cells, this means that the impact of most newly acquired somatic mutations is likely to be very small in terms of total cellular or organ system function; however, because of the manyfold higher mutation rate during mtDNA replication, numerous different mutations may accumulate with the aging of the organism. It has been proposed that the total cumulative burden of acquired somatic mtDNA mutations with age may result in an overall perturbation of mitochondrial function, contributing to an age-related reduction in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and increased production of damaging ROS. According to this formulation, the high somatic mtDNA mutation rate and the global effect of numerous cumulative mutations that disrupt mitochondrial function counterbalance the reduced impact of the multiple copy number of each individual mtDNA mutation. The accumulation of such acquired somatic mtDNA mutations with aging may contribute to age-related diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiovascular disease, in any specific individual. However, such somatic mtDNA mutations are not carried forward to the next generation, and the hereditary impact of mtDNA mutagenesis requires separate consideration of events in the female germ line.

The multiple mtDNA copy number within the maternal germ cells results in the phenomenon of heteroplasmy of inherited mtDNA mutations. Heteroplasmy for a particular mtDNA sequence variant or mutation results from the coexistence within the oocyte of mtDNA molecules bearing both versions of the sequence variant (Fig. e18-3). In the case of pathogenic mutations, this means coexistence within the oocyte of both the wild-type and mutant versions. For each oocyte, the percentage of mtDNA molecules bearing each version of the polymorphic sequence variant or mutation depends on stochastic events related to partitioning of mtDNA molecules during the process of oogenesis itself. Thus, oocytes differ from each other in the degree of heteroplasmy for that sequence variant or mutation. In turn, the heteroplasmic state is carried forward to the zygote and to the organism as a whole to varying degrees, depending on mitotic segregation of mtDNA molecules during organ system development and maintenance. For this reason, in vitro fertilization followed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not as predictive of the genetic health of the offspring in the case of mtDNA mutations as it is in the case of the nuclear genome.

Figure e18-3

 
 
 
Heteroplasmy and the mitochondrial genetic bottleneck. During the production of primary oocytes, a selected number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules are transferred into each oocyte. Oocyte maturation is associated with the rapid replication of this mtDNA population. This restriction-amplification event can lead to a random shift of mtDNA mutational load between generations and is responsible for the variable levels of mutated mtDNA observed in affected offspring from mothers with pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Mitochondria that contain mutated mtDNA are shown in red, and those with normal mtDNA are shown in green.

Mitotic segregation refers to the unequal distribution of wild-type and mutant versions of the mtDNA molecules during all cell divisions that occur during prenatal development and subsequently throughout the lifetime of an individual. Such mtDNA sequence variants may be entirely silent in terms of disease phenotype or predisposition or, alternatively, potentially affect one or more aspects of mitochondrial function in a manner that gives rise to a disease phenotype or predisposition if present in high copy number. The phenotypic effect or disease impact thus will be a function not only of the inherent disruptive effect (pathogenicity) on the mtDNA-encoded gene (coding region mutations) or integrity of the mtDNA molecule (control region mutations) but also of its distribution among the multiple copies of mtDNA in the various mitochondria, cells, and tissues of the affected individual. This leads to a "threshold" effect in which the actual expression of disease depends on the relative percentage of mitochondria whose function is disrupted by mtDNA mutations. Consequently, there is tremendous heterogeneity in disease penetrance and severity as well as complexity of organ system involvement among the offspring of women with pathogenic heteroplasmic mutations. This heterogeneity arises from differences in the degree of heteroplasmy among oocytes of the affected woman and with subsequent mitotic segregation of the pathogenic mutation during tissue and organ development and throughout the lifetime of the individual offspring. This may confound the diagnosis of an mtDNA genetic cause of disease.

In contrast to classic mtDNA diseases, most of which begin in childhood and are the result of heteroplasmic mutations as noted above, during the course of human evolution, certain mtDNA sequence variants have drifted to a state of homoplasmy in which all the mtDNA molecules in the organism contain the new sequence variant. This arises due to a "bottleneck" effect followed by genetic drift during the very process of oogenesis itself (Fig. e18-3). In other words, during certain stages of oogenesis, the mtDNA copy number is reduced so substantially that the particular mtDNA species bearing the novel or derived sequence variant may become the increasingly predominant, and eventually exclusive, version of the mtDNA for that particular nucleotide site. All the offspring of a woman bearing an mtDNA sequence variant or mutation that has become homoplasmic will also be homoplasmic for that variant and will transmit the sequence variant forward in subsequent generations. This is the main process that establishes a new mtDNA haplotype in the human population.

Considerations of reproductive fitness limit the evolutionary or population emergence of homoplasmic mutations that are lethal or cause severe disease in infancy or childhood. Thus, with a number of notable exceptions (e.g., mtDNA mutations that cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; see below), most homoplasmic mutations were considered neutral markers of human evolution〞useful and interesting in the population genetics analysis of shared maternal ancestry but with little significance in human phenotypic variation or disease predisposition. However, recent research and clinical attention have focused on the potential for certain of these homoplasmic mtDNA sequence variants to contribute to the evolutionary adaptation of populations to their climatic environment or to predispose to heritable late postreproductive and age-associated diseases.
 
Mitochondrial DNA Disease

The true prevalence of mtDNA disease is difficult to estimate because of the phenotypic heterogeneity that occurs as a function of heteroplasmy, the challenge of detecting and assessing heteroplasmy in different affected tissues, and the other unique features of mtDNA function and inheritance described above. It is estimated that at least 1 in 200 healthy humans harbors a pathogenic mtDNA mutation that potentially causes disease but that heteroplasmic germ-line pathogenic mtDNA mutations affect up to approximately 1 in 5000 individuals. The true overall impact of mtDNA mutation in human health and disease may be much greater if the potential contribution of homoplasmic mtDNA sequence variation to common complex diseases that appear in the postreproductive age also is considered.

The true disease burden will be known only with the ability to distinguish a completely neutral sequence variant from a true phenotype-modifying or pathogenic mutation, when an accurate assessment of heteroplasmy can be determined with fidelity, and when the epistatic interactions of mtDNA sequence variations with mutations in the nuclear genome can be expressed using a systems biology approach (Chap. e19).

Overview of Clinical and Pathologic Features of Human MTDNA Disease

In light of the vital roles of mitochondria in all nucleated cells, it is not surprising that mtDNA mutations can affect numerous tissues with pleiotropic effects. More than 200 different disease-causing, mostly heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations have been described that affect ETC function. Figure e18-4 provides a partial mtDNA map of some of the better characterized of these disorders. A number of clinical clues can increase the index of suspicion for a heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation as an etiology of a heritable trait or disease, including (1) familial clustering with absence of paternal transmission, (2) adherence to one of the classic syndromes (see below) or paradigmatic combinations of disease phenotypes involving several organ systems that normally do not fit together within a single nuclear genomic mutation category, (3) a complex of laboratory and pathologic abnormalities that reflect disruption in cellular energetics (e.g., lactic acidosis and neurodegenerative and myodegenerative symptoms with the finding of ragged red fibers, reflecting the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria under the muscle sarcolemmal membrane), and (4) a mosaic pattern reflecting a heteroplasmic state.

Heteroplasmy sometimes can be demonstrated elegantly at the tissue level by using histochemical staining for enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, with a mosaic pattern indicating heterogeneity of the genotype for the coding region for the mtDNA-encoded enzyme. Complex II, CoQ, and cytochrome c are encoded exclusively by nuclear DNA. In contrast, complexes I, III, IV, and V contain at least some subunits encoded by mtDNA. Just 3 of the 13 subunits of the ETC complex IV enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, are encoded by mtDNA; therefore, this enzyme has the lowest threshold for dysfunction when a threshold of mutated mtDNA is reached. Histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity in tissues of patients affected with heteroplasmic inherited mtDNA mutations (or with the somatic accumulation of mtDNA mutations; see below) can show a mosaic pattern of reduced histochemical staining in comparison with histochemical staining for the complex II enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase (Fig. e18-5). Heteroplasmy also can be detected at the genetic level through direct mtDNA genotyping in special conditions, though clinically significant low levels of heteroplasmy can escape detection in genomic samples extracted from whole blood using conventional genotyping and sequencing techniques.

Clinically, the most striking overall characteristic of mitochondrial genetic disease is the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with mtDNA mutations. This extends to intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity for the same mtDNA pathogenic mutation and, conversely, to the overlap of phenotypic disease manifestations with distinct mutations. Thus, although fairly consistent and well-defined "classic" syndromes have been attributed to specific mutations, frequently "nonclassic" combinations of disease phenotypes ranging from isolated myopathy to extensive multisystem disease are encountered, rendering genotype-phenotype correlation challenging. In both classic and nonclassic mtDNA disorders, there is often a clustering of some combination of abnormalities affecting the neurologic system (including optic nerve atrophy, pigment retinopathy, sensorineural hearing loss), cardiac and skeletal muscle (including extraocular muscles), and endocrine and metabolic systems (including diabetes mellitus). Additional organ systems that may be affected include the hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems, though these systems are involved more frequently in infants and children. Disease-causing mtDNA coding region mutations can affect either one of the 13 protein encoding genes or one of the 24 protein synthetic genes. Clinical manifestations do not readily distinguish these two categories, though lactic acidosis and muscle pathologic findings tend to be more prominent in the latter. In all cases, either defective ATP production due to disturbances in the ETC or enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species has been invoked as the mediating biochemical mechanism between mtDNA mutation and disease manifestation.

MTDNA Disease Presentations

The clinical presentation of adult patients with mtDNA disease can be divided into three categories: (1) clinical features suggestive of mitochondrial disease (Table e18-2) but not a well-defined classic syndrome, (2) classic mtDNA syndromes, and (3) clinical presentation confined to one organ system (e.g., isolated sensorineural deafness, cardiomyopathy, or diabetes mellitus).

Table e18-2 Common Features of mtDNA-Associated Diseases in Adults

 
 
Neurologic: stroke, epilepsy, migraine headache, peripheral neuropathy, cranial neuropathy (optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness, dysphagia, dysphasia) 
Skeletal myopathy: ophthalmoplegia, exercise intolerance, myalgia 
Cardiac: conduction block, cardiomyopathy 
Respiratory: hypoventilation, aspiration pneumonitis 
Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, premature ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism 
Ophthalmologic: cataracts, pigment retinopathy, neurologic and myopathic (optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia) 
 

 

Table e18-3 provides a summary of eight illustrative classic mtDNA syndromes or disorders that affect adult patients and highlights some of the most interesting features of mtDNA disease in terms of molecular pathogenesis, inheritance, and clinical presentation. The first five of these syndromes result from heritable point mutations in either protein-encoding or protein synthetic mtDNA genes; the other three result from rearrangements or deletions that usually do not involve the germ line.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a common cause of maternally inherited visual failure. LHON typically presents during young adulthood with subacute painless loss of vision in one eye, with symptoms developing in the other eye 6每12 weeks after the initial onset. In some instances, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiac conduction defects are observed. In >95% of cases, LHON is due to one of three homoplasmic point mutations of mtDNA that affect genes that encode different subunits of complex I of the mitochondrial ETC; however, not all individuals who inherit a primary LHON mtDNA mutation develop optic neuropathy, indicating that additional environmental (e.g., tobacco exposure) or genetic factors are important in the etiology of the disorder. Both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomic background modify disease penetrance. Indeed, a region of the X chromosome containing a high-risk haplotype for LHON has been identified, supporting the formulation that nuclear genes act as modifiers and affording an explanation for the male prevalence of LHON. This haplotype can be used in predictive genomic testing and prenatal screening for this disease. In contrast to the other classic mtDNA disorders, it is of interest that patients with this syndrome are often homoplasmic for the disease-causing mutation. The somewhat later onset in young adulthood and the modifying effect of protective background nuclear genomic haplotypes may have enabled homoplasmic pathogenic mutations to escape evolutionary censoring.

Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) is probably the most common mtDNA disease, consisting of a progressive encephalomyopathy characterized by repeated strokelike events involving mainly posterior cerebral areas. Of note, brain lesions do not respect the distribution of vascular territories. Recurrent migraine-like headache and vomiting, exercise intolerance, seizures, short stature, and lactic acidosis are other common clinical features. The most commonly described pathogenic point mutations are A3243G and T3271C in the gene encoding the leucine tRNA.

Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) is a multisystem disorder characterized by myoclonus, seizures, ataxia, and myopathy with ragged red fibers. Hearing loss, exercise intolerance, neuropathy, and short stature are often present. Almost all MERRF patients have mutation in the mtDNA tRNAlys gene, and the A8344G mutation in the mtDNA gene encoding the lysine amino acid tRNA is responsible for 80每90% of MERRF cases.

Neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) is characterized by moderate diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and symmetric lesions of the basal ganglia on MRI. A heteroplasmic T8993G mutation in the gene ATPase 6 subunit gene has been identified as causative. Ragged red fibers are not observed in muscle biopsy. When >95% of mtDNA molecules are mutant, a more severe clinical neuroradiologic and neuropathologic picture (Leigh syndrome) emerges. Point mutations in the mtDNA gene encoding the 12S rRNA result in heritable nonsyndromic hearing loss. One such mutation causes heritable ototoxic susceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics, which opens a pathway for a simple pharmacogenetic test in the appropriate clinical settings.

Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), sporadic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), and Pearson syndrome are three disease phenotypes caused by large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, including partial deletions or partial duplication. The majority of single large-scale rearrangements of mtDNA are thought to result from clonal amplification of a single sporadic mutational event occurring in the maternal oocyte or during early embryonic development. Since germ-line involvement is rare, most cases are sporadic rather than inherited.

KSS is characterized by the triad of onset before age 20, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Cerebellar syndrome, heart block, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content, diabetes, and short stature are also part of the syndrome. Single deletions/duplication also can result in milder phenotypes such as PEO, characterized by late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, proximal myopathy, and exercise intolerance. In both KSS and PEO, diabetes mellitus and hearing loss are common accompaniments. Pearson syndrome also is characterized by diabetes mellitus from pancreatic insufficiency, together with pancytopenia and lactic acidosis, caused by the large-scale sporadic deletion of several mtDNA genes.

Two important dilemmas in classic mtDNA disease have benefited from recent important research insights. The first relates to the greater involvement of neuronal, muscular, renal, hepatic, and pancreatic manifestations in mtDNA disease in these syndromes. This observation appropriately has been attributed mostly to the high energy utilization of the involved tissues and organ systems and, hence, greater dependency on mitochondrial ETC integrity and health. However, since mutations are stochastic events, mitochondrial mutations should occur in any organ during embryogenesis and development. Recently, additional explanations have been suggested based on studies of the common A3243G transition. The proportion of this mutation in peripheral blood cells was shown to decrease exponentially with age. A selective process acting at the stem cell level with a strong bias against the mutated form would have its greatest effect in reducing the mutant mtDNA only in highly proliferating cells, such as those derived from the hematopoietic system. Tissues and organs with lower cell turnover, such as those involved with mtDNA mutations, would not benefit from this effect and thus would be affected the most.

Another important question of interest arises from the observation that only a subset of mtDNA mutations account for the majority of the familial mtDNA diseases. The random occurrence of mutations in the mtDNA sequence should yield a more uniform distribution of disease-causing mutations. However, recent studies utilizing the introduction of one severe and one mild point mutation into the female germ line of experimental animals demonstrated selective elimination during oogenesis of the severe and selective retention of the milder mutations, with the emergence of mitochondrial disease in offspring after multiple generations. Thus, oogenesis itself can act as an "evolutionary" filter for mtDNA disease.

The Investigation of Suspected MTDNA Disease

The clinical presentations of classic syndromes, groupings of disease manifestations in multiple organ systems, or unexplained isolated presentations of one of the disease features of a classic mtDNA syndrome should prompt a systematic clinical investigation, as outlined in Fig. e18-6. Despite the centrality of disruptive oxidative phosphorylation, an elevated blood lactate level is neither specific nor sensitive because there are many causes of blood lactic acidosis, and many patients with mtDNA defects that present in adulthood have normal blood lactate. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate is a more specific test for mitochondrial disease if there is central nervous system involvement. The serum creatine kinase may be elevated but is often normal even in the presence of a proximal myopathy. Urinary organic and amino acids also may be abnormal, reflecting metabolic and kidney proximal tubule dysfunction. Every patient with seizures or cognitive decline should have an electroencephalogram. A brain CT scan may show calcified basal ganglia or bilateral hypodense regions with cortical atrophy. MRI is indicated in patients with brainstem signs or strokelike episodes.

CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ECG, electrocardiogram; EEG, electroencephalogram; EMG, electromyogram; MELAS, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; MERFF, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; LHON, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism.
 
 

For some mitochondrial diseases, it is possible to obtain an accurate diagnosis with a simple molecular genetic screen. For examples, 95% of patients with LHON harbor one of three mtDNA point mutations (A11778G, A3460G, and T14484C). These patients have very high levels of mutated mtDNA in peripheral blood cells, and it is therefore appropriate to send a blood sample for molecular genetic analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction fragment length polymorphism. The same is true for most MERRF patients who harbor a point mutation in the lysine tRNA gene at position 8344. In contrast, patients with the A3243G MELAS mutation often have low levels of mutated mtDNA in blood. If clinical suspicion is strong enough to warrant peripheral blood testing, patients with a negative result should be investigated further with a skeletal muscle biopsy.

Muscle biopsy histochemical analysis is the cornerstone for investigation of patients with suspected mitochondrial disease. Histochemical analysis may show subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria with the appearance of ragged red fibers. Electron microscopy may show abnormal mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions. Muscle histochemistry may show cytochrome c oxidase (COX)每deficient fibers, which indicate mitochondrial dysfunction (Fig. e18-5). Respiratory chain complex assays also may show reduced enzyme function. Either of these two abnormalities confirms the presence of a mitochondrial disease, to be followed by an in-depth molecular genetic analysis.

Relevant evidence has provided important insights into the importance of nuclear-mtDNA genomic cross-talk and has provided a descriptive framework for classifying and understanding disorders that emanate from perturbations in this cross-talk. Although these are not strictly considered as mtDNA genetic disorders, their manifestations overlap with those highlighted above.
 
Impact of Homoplasmic Sequence Variation on Heritable Traits and Disease

The relationship among the degree of heteroplasmy, tissue distribution of the mutant mtDNA, and disease phenotype simplifies the inference of a clear causative relationship between heteroplasmic mutation and disease. With the exception of certain mutations (e.g., those causing most cases of LHON), the drift to homoplasmy of such mutations would be precluded normally by the severity of impaired oxidative phosphorylation and the consequent reduction in reproductive fitness. Therefore, it previously was thought that sequence variants that have reached homoplasmy should be neutral in terms of human evolution and useful only for tracing human evolution, demography, and migration; however, recent studies have suggested that some homoplasmic mtDNA sequence variants may affect heritable traits or health through one or more mechanisms.

The first such mechanism relates to locally adaptive evolutionary forces. As noted above, homoplasmic mtDNA sequence variants that partition population groups are designated as defining maternal "haplogroups" or "haplotypes." Striking discontinuities have been observed in mtDNA haplogroup distribution among climatic zones around the globe. This phenomenon has been attributed to adaptive differences in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and consequent thermogenesis in accordance with differences in prevailing climates in different global geographic regions during much of human evolution. A potential health implication of this finding is the possibility that these mutations might result in deleterious effects on energy metabolism and caloric balance in the current era of human transglobal migration and ability to modulate residential climate.

A much broader extrapolation of the foregoing mechanism states that many homoplasmic mtDNA mutations affect human health in the postreproductive age only and therefore escaped evolutionary censoring altogether. In the modern era of increased median life span, such mutations are postulated to account for a considerable burden of age-associated common complex disease. During the previous century alone, mean life expectancy rose from ~47 years to ~77 years in many parts of the developing world; therefore, late-onset effects of a subset of homoplasmic mtDNA mutations may contribute significantly to the burden of human illness only in the current era, when a relatively higher percentage of the population is surviving beyond reproductive age. The challenge is to identify those homoplasmic mutations that modify mtDNA function and contribute to late-onset, common complex disease. Indeed, in light of the finding that global populations are more differentiated at the level of mtDNA than they are at the level of the nuclear genome, it is also attractive to postulate that population differences with the predisposition to certain late-onset common complex metabolic diseases may be attributed in part to population-based mtDNA sequence variation. The diseases that have been of particular interest are those involving the very organ systems familiar from the known classic heteroplasmic mtDNA syndromes described above.

Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)

Insulin release by pancreatic beta cells is modulated in response to ATP metabolism, and insulin action is perturbed by metabolites of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This has led investigators to consider mtDNA itself as a potential genomic locus for susceptibility to T2DM. A rather clear-cut case is that of a mutation in mtDNA nucleotide 3243 encoding the mitochondrial tRNA for the amino acid leucine. Even a low level of heteroplasmy for a particular point mutation in the mtDNA tRNA gene encoding the leucine tRNA is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of up to 1% of all cases of T2DM. This and other findings at the biochemical and population genetics levels have motivated the search for more definitive evidence of the role of homoplasmic variants in the predisposition to metabolic syndrome and T2DM. Such evidence has been obtained with the finding of significant segregation of a homoplasmic mtDNA tRNA mutation (T to C transition in the nucleotide immediately 5' to the isoleucine tRNA anticodon) with metabolic syndrome phenotypes in a large Caucasian kindred.

Since the metabolic syndrome is so common and can result from numerous different genetic susceptibility loci and environmental causes and since many nuclear genetic susceptibility loci and environmental risk factors have been identified, special features in this particular reported kindred enabled the accurate distinction of affected from unaffected individuals for purposes of determining the causality of the mtDNA variant. The affected individuals had signs of hypomagnesemia, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. This particular mutation in a tRNA-encoding mtDNA gene also highlights the expected difference in the phenotypic impact of mutations in genomic regions encoding tRNAs in the mitochondrial versus the nuclear genome, since a mutation in the latter would affect too many gene products to be compatible with life.

Beyond the immediate medical and biologic significance, the importance of the findings in this kindred is to highlight the fact that the contribution of common homoplasmic mutations to common complex late-onset human disease syndromes is probably underestimated. A common variant mtDNA sequence variant (T16189C) has been related to low birth weight, impaired glucose tolerance, and metabolic syndrome in specific populations. However, rigorous population-based association studies using case-control designs have not provided definitive evidence for a relationship between mtDNA haplogroups and susceptibility to T2DM or its complications.

Neurodegenerative Disease

The prominence of neurologic injury in classic mtDNA diseases, together with the presumed role of reactive oxygen species in neuronal injury and the late age of onset of neurodegenerative diseases, has led investigators to consider the possibility that homoplasmic variants in mtDNA sequence that define population haplogroups also may modify the susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Particular configurations of mtDNA sequence polymorphisms that define population haplogroups designated in phylogenetics by the labels J, T, U, and K have been reported to be potentially protective against Parkinson's disease in different populations. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, some studies have shown haplogroup J to increase risk, with haplogroup D decreasing risk. Mutations in the mtDNA control region do not produce defective polypeptide products but affect both the light and heavy strand promoters, as well as the heavy strand origin of replication, and thus may modulate mtDNA replication and transcription. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequence variants (e.g., T414G) have been identified in Alzheimer's disease brains in association with a significant reduction in mtDNA copy number and a reduction in specific transcripts. A number of studies have focused on the interaction of mtDNA haplogroup每designating mutations with the well-established Alzheimer's disease risk alleles at the nuclear apoE4 locus. From those studies it was postulated that the ETC-uncoupling mutations that minimize ROS production are those which confer protection against neuronal injury, but definitive proof of this postulate awaits further studies.

Other Diseases and Nondisease Heritable Traits

Consideration of the potential contribution of mtDNA mutations to numerous heritable traits and common complex diseases requires consideration of the common variant每common phenotype model (including disease phenotype) versus the rare variant每common phenotype model, which are also applicable to the nuclear genome. According to the common variant每common phenotype model, DNA sequence variants inherited identically by descent and present in large numbers of individuals within one or more populations may predispose to common phenotypes. In the rare variant每common phenotype model, different mutations within one or more genetic loci involved in a particular molecular pathway may predispose to a common phenotype or disease. In this regard, the entire mtDNA can be considered a single genomic locus. Genomewide association studies have been utilized to try to map common variants responsible for common diseases, using case-control or multiplex family approaches. These approaches have been applied to common variants in mtDNA sequence as well, as noted above for metabolic syndrome and neurodegenerative disease. Additional examples include the variable length of an mtDNA control region polycytosine stretch (16189 variant) as a contributing genomic influence in the onset of age-related cardiomyopathy with T2DM. An association of mtDNA haplogroup T and a polymorphism at position 13368 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been reported in a European population, and a number of studies have suggested an association between mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in predisposition to heart failure. In the case of age-related cancers as well, the association of a number of heritable homoplasmic mtDNA mutations with certain cancers has been reported, including prostate, kidney, and breast cancer.

The association of mtDNA haplogroups with at least two nondisease heritable traits also has been studied: life expectancy and exercise endurance. Several mtDNA control region mutations, including the C150T mutation that shifts the heavy chain origin of replication, have been reported to accumulate with age in specific tissues, including lymphocytes of centenarians and their twins. The relationship between the C150T mutation and longevity has been replicated in Italian, Finnish, and Japanese populations, suggesting a common ancient origin. The alternative of evolutionary convergence of this mutation for longevity seems less likely, as the trait does not confer reproductive advantage. The association of haplogroup J and its subhaplogroups with longevity has been demonstrated in north Italian, north Irish, and Finnish sample sets. At least in the Italian study, this association was shown to be population-specific, since it was not reproduced in sample sets of southern Italian communities. Furthermore, in the case of the north Italian communities, an additional interaction of the mtDNA haplogroup designated as J2 with several different mutations adjacent to replication origins, including the aforementioned C150T, has been noted.

The functional importance of one or more of the mutations designated as haplogroup J is strengthened further by the finding of the interesting interaction with the mtDNA mutations that cause LHON, as noted previously. Reduced disease predilection suggests that one or more of the ancient sequence variants designated as haplogroup J appear to attenuate predisposition to degenerative disease in the face of other risk factors. It has been proposed that the mtDNA haplogroups associated with exceptional longevity favor a relatively uncoupled state of the ETC, with reduced efficiency of production of ATP and ROS and increased thermogenesis. Although this has not been demonstrated biochemically, the notion is strengthened by the finding of a relative paucity of these mtDNA haplogroups among successful endurance athletes, for whom maximum efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation confers an athletic competitive advantage.

It should be noted that not all studies have replicated associations of mtDNA haplogroups with longevity, athletic performance, or other heritable phenotypes. Most of these studies are limited by small sample sizes, possible genotyping inaccuracies, and the possibility of population stratification or ethnic ancestry bias. Since mtDNA haplogroups are so prominently partitioned along phylogeographic lines, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that a haplogroup for which an association has been found is simply a marker for differences in populations with a societal or environmental difference or with different allele frequencies at other genomic loci that are actually causally related to the heritable trait or disease of interest. The difficulty in generating cellular or animal models to test the functional influence of homoplasmic sequence variants (as a result of mtDNA polyploidy) further compounds the challenge. The most likely formulation is that the risk conferred by different mtDNA haplogroup每defining homoplasmic mutations for common diseases depends on the concomitant nuclear genomic background, together with environmental influences. Progress in minimizing potentially misleading associations in mtDNA heritable trait and disease studies should include ensuring adequate sample size taken from a large sample recruitment base, together with the use of carefully matched controls and population structure determination, along with analysis that takes into account epistatic interactions with other genomic loci and environmental factors.
 
Impact of Acquired Somatic MTDNA Mutation on Human Health and Disease

Studies on aging humans and animals have shown a potentially important correlation of age with the accumulation of heterogeneous mtDNA mutations, especially in the organ systems that undergo the most prominent age-related degenerative tissue phenotype. Sequencing of PCR-amplified single mtDNA molecules has demonstrated an average of two to three point mutations per molecule in elderly subjects compared with younger ones. Point mutations observed include those responsible for known heritable heteroplasmic mtDNA disorders such as the A3344G and A3243G mutations responsible for the MERRF and MELAS syndromes, respectively. However, the cumulative burden of these acquired somatic point mutations with age was observed to remain well below the threshold expected for phenotypic expression (<2%). Point mutations at other sites not normally involved in inherited mtDNA disorders also have been shown to accumulate to much higher levels in some tissues of elderly individuals, with the description of tissue-specific "hot spots" for mtDNA point mutations. Along the same lines, an age-associated and tissue-specific accumulation of mtDNA deletions has been observed, including deletions involved in known heritable mtDNA disorders, as well as others. The accumulation of functional mtDNA deletions in a given tissue is expected to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, as reflected in an age-associated patchy and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity on histochemical staining, especially in skeletal and cardiac muscle and brain. A particularly well-studied and potentially important example is the accumulation of mtDNA deletions and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency observed in neurons of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease patients.

The progressive accumulation of ROS has been proposed as the key factor connecting mtDNA mutations with aging and age-related disease pathogenesis (Fig. e18-7). As noted above, ROS are a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation and are removed by detoxifying antioxidants into less harmful moieties; however, exaggerated production of ROS or impaired removal results in their accumulation. One of the main targets for ROS-mediated injury is DNA, and mtDNA is particularly vulnerable because of its lack of protective histones and less efficient injury repair systems compared with nuclear DNA. In turn, accumulation of mtDNA mutations results in inefficient oxidative phosphorylation, with the potential for excessive production of ROS, generating a "vicious cycle" of cumulative mtDNA damage. Indeed, measurement of the oxidative stress biomarker 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine has been used to measure age-dependent increases in mtDNA oxidative damage at a rate exceeding that of nuclear DNA. It should be noted that mtDNA mutation potentially can occur in postmitotic cells as well, since mtDNA replication is not synchronized with the cell cycle. Two other proposed links between mtDNA mutation and aging, besides ROS-mediated tissue injury, are the perturbations in efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation with disturbed cellular aerobic function and perturbations in apoptotic pathways whose execution steps involve mitochondrial activity.

Figure e18-7

 
 
 
Multiple pathways of DNA damage and aging. Mitochondrial DNA damage and aging. Multiple factors may impinge on the integrity of mitochondria that lead to loss of cell function, apoptosis, and aging. The classic pathway is indicated with blue arrows; the generation of ROS (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals), as a by-product of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, results in damage to mitochondrial macromolecules, including the mtDNA, with the latter leading to deleterious mutations. When these factors damage the mitochondrial energy-generating apparatus beyond a functional threshold, proteins are released from the mitochondria that activate the caspase pathway, leading to apoptosis, cell death, and aging. ROS, reactive oxygen species. (Reproduced with permission from L Loeb et al: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:18769, 2005.)
 
 

Genetic intervention studies in animal models have sought to clarify the potential causative relationship between acquired somatic mtDNA mutation and the aging phenotype, the role of ROS in particular. Replication of the mitochondrial genome is mediated by the activity of the nuclear-encoded polymerase  gene. A transgenic homozygous mouse knock-in mutation of this gene renders the polymerase enzyme deficient in proofreading and results in a three- to fivefold increase in the mtDNA mutation rate. Such mice develop a premature aging phenotype, which includes subcutaneous lipoatrophy, alopecia, kyphonia, and weight loss with premature death. Although the finding of increases in mtDNA mutation and mitochondrial dysfunction with age has been solidly established, the causative role and specific contribution of mitochondrial ROS to aging and age-related disease in humans have yet to be proved. Similarly, although many tumors display higher levels of heterogeneous mtDNA mutations, a causal relationship to tumorigenesis has not been proved.

Besides the age-dependent acquired accumulation in somatic cells of heterogeneous point mutations and deletions, a quite different effect of nonheritable and acquired mtDNA mutation has been described affecting tissue stem cells. In particular, disease phenotypes attributed to acquired mtDNA mutation have been observed in sporadic and apparently nonfamilial cases involving a single individual or even tissue, usually skeletal muscle. The presentation consists of decreased exercise tolerance and myalgias, sometimes progressing to rhabdomyolysis. As in the case of the sporadic heteroplasmic large-scale deletion classic syndromes of chronic PEO, Pearson syndrome, and KSS, the absence of a maternal inheritance pattern, together with the finding of limited tissue distribution, suggests a molecular pathogenic mechanism emanating from mutations arising de novo in muscle stem cells after germ-line differentiation (somatic mutations that are not sporadic and occur in tissue-specific stem cells during fetal development or in the postnatal maintenance or postinjury repair stage). Such mutations would be expected to be propagated only within the progeny of that stem cell and affect a particular tissue within a specific individual, without evidence of heritability.
 
Prospects for Prevention and Treatment of MTDNA Disease

Genetic Counseling in MTDNA Disorders

The provision of accurate genetic counseling and reproductive options to families with mtDNA mutations is complicated by the unique genetic features of mtDNA that distinguish it from Mendelian genetics. Although there is no risk of disease transmission from an affected male, the risk of maternal transmission of disease phenotypes associated with heteroplasmic mutations is a function of differential segregation and copy number of mutant mtDNA during oogenesis and, subsequently, after tissue and organ development in the offspring. This is rarely predictable with any degree of accuracy. In addition, interactions with the mtDNA haplotype background or nuclear human genome (as in the case of LHON) serve as an additional important determinant of disease penetrance. Environmental interactions are also of importance, such as the strong and consistent association between visual loss in LHON and smoking. A clinical penetrance of 93% was found in men who smoked. Asymptomatic carriers of a LHON mtDNA mutation therefore should be strongly advised not to smoke and to moderate their alcohol intake. Although not a cure, these interventions might stave off the devastating clinical manifestations of the LHON mutation. Another example is the familial syndrome of ototoxic susceptibility to aminoglycosides in the case of the mtDNA A1555G mutation of the 12S rRNA encoding gene.

The value of prenatal genetic testing is also questionable, partly owing to the absence of data on the rules that govern the segregation of wild-type and mutant mtDNA species (heteroplasmy) among tissue in the developing embryo. Three factors are required to ensure the reliability of prenatal testing: (1) a close correlation between the mutant load and the disease severity, (2) a uniform distribution of mutant load among tissues, and (3) no major change in mutant load with time. These criteria are suggested to be fulfilled for the NARP T8993G mutation but do not seem to apply to other mtDNA disorders. In fact, the level of mutant mtDNA in a chorionic villus or amniotic fluid sample may be very different from the level in the fetus, and it would be difficult to deduce whether the mutational load in the prenatal samples provide clinically useful information regarding the postnatal and adult state.

Treatment of MTDNA Disorders

The polyploid nature of the mitochondrial genome, the inability to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to the organelle through mitochondrial transfection, and the phenomenon of heteroplasmy coupled with the relative unavailability of useful preclinical experimental models have hampered progress in the development of curative treatments for mtDNA disease. One possible approach to "diluting" or even entirely eliminating the mutant mtDNA is applicable only in the earliest embryonic state and in effect represents a form of germ-line preventive therapy (Fig. e18-8). This would involve cytoplasmic transfer of normal mitochondria into the oocyte of a woman affected with the heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation or, more radically, the use of a normal donor oocyte that has been enucleated and into which the nucleus of the affected recipient mother has been introduced. These approaches have not met with widely reported clinical success. In a newer study, the nucleus (containing both maternal and paternal DNA with a few adherent mitochondria) from a severely abnormal human embryo was transplanted into a donated oocyte after removal of its nuclear DNA. The resulting embryo developed normally for the first 6 days, at which time it was set aside for nonmedical reasons. The long-term future feasibility of this approach is strengthened by similar mtDNA genetic replacement studies in ova of nonhuman primates that have been taken to successful birth of healthy offspring. The threshold effect, in which even a small increase in nonmutant mtDNA copies or limited amelioration of metabolic dysfunction might greatly improve the disease phenotype and benefit patient health, further bolsters hope that this approach may reduce the burden of human mtDNA disease in the future.

Oocyte donation: currently permitted in some constituencies but limited by the availability of oocyte donors. C.

Nuclear transfer: research stage, including initial studies in nonhuman primates. Red represents mutant mitochondrial DNA, pink and white represent successively higher proportions of normal mitochondrial DNA, and blue represents genetic material from an unrelated donor.

Nevertheless, until such human genetic intervention studies reach the routine clinical arena, counteracting the most damaging metabolic changes currently represents the mainstay of treatment. The avoidance of well-characterized environmental risk factors as noted above, such as tobacco use in the case of LHON, and the avoidance of aminoglycosides in the case of mtDNA A1555G mutation have very major benefits. Less specific interventions in the case of other disorders involve combined treatment strategies and include dietary intervention and removal of toxic metabolites. Cofactors and vitamin supplements are used widely in the treatment of diseases of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, although there is little evidence, apart from anecdotal reports, to support their use. This includes administration of artificial electron acceptors, including vitamin K3, vitamin C, and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10); administration of cofactors (coenzymes), including riboflavin, carnitine, and creatine; and use of oxygen radical scavengers, such as vitamin E, copper, selenium, ubiquinone, and idebenone. Drugs that could interfere with mitochondrial defects, such as the anesthetic agent propofol, barbiturates, and high doses of valproate, should be avoided. Supplementation with the nitric oxide synthase substrate l-arginine has been advocated as a vasodilator treatment during strokelike episodes.

In the case of homoplasmic mtDNA variants that predispose to late-onset common complex disease, it is more realistic to think of using their identification in a specific patient as a nonmodifiable risk factor, which guides the aggressiveness of medical intervention for the associated modifiable risk factors for the same disorder. For example, the identification of a haplogroup-defining homoplasmic mtDNA mutation that confers added risk for metabolic syndrome should trigger intensive dietary, lifestyle, and medical intervention to reduce other factors that promote the metabolic syndrome and its complications. In the case of acquired somatic mutations〞to the extent that a vicious cycle of ROS production with mtDNA mutation plays a role〞effective antioxidant and ROS scavenging therapeutic strategies may prove to be of benefit.

The Human Microbiome: Introduction

The words well-being and microbes typically are not spoken in the same breath. Microbes have a strong negative connotation in contemporary societies and are viewed in a warlike context. Disease-producing or pathogenic microbes are indeed serious threats to human health and have received justifiable attention from the inception of the field of microbiology. The list of known and notorious pathogens is long. However, most human encounters with microbes are not hostile but benign or even beneficial. Advances in DNA sequencing and computational biology now permit comprehensive description of the composition of and the roles played by the microbial communities (microbiota) associated with the human body.

Like all animals on the planet, humans have had to adapt to a microbe-dominated biosphere. The number of microbes on Earth is staggering. It has been estimated that 1030 microbes live in the ocean, in surface and subsurface terrestrial ecosystems, and on and inside animals and plants. Microbes, which are defined here as microscopic living organisms that belong to any of the three known domains of life on Earth (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), inhabit the exposed exterior and interior surfaces of the human body (e.g., the skin, mouth, airways, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina). The uterus traditionally has been thought to be microbe-free, although new evidence may prompt a reevaluation of the idea that this ecosystem is completely sterile throughout gestation. Colonization with microbes begins no later than during parturition; in the ensuing years, microbes come to outnumber human cells by an estimated tenfold in the human body. Therefore, a comprehensive view of humans as a life form entails consideration of the body's microbial and Homo sapiens cells together as a connected network'a coevolved symbiosis ("living together")'in which various body habitats serve as homes to microbial communities. These habitats harbor microbiota composed of members that function as mutualists (both host and microbe benefit from the other's presence), commensals (one partner benefits, and the other is seemingly unaffected), and potential or overt pathogens (one partner benefits, and the other is harmed).

Human Microbiome Projects

Human microbiome projects (HMPs) reflect this view of the human body as an amalgamation of human and microbial cells as well as human and microbial genes. These projects represent a confluence of ongoing technical and computational advances in the genome sciences. The newest generation of massively parallel DNA sequencers can be used to document〞with unprecedented speed and economy〞which microbes compose a microbiota and to characterize a microbiota's gene content (its microbiome). Key terms relevant to HMPs are defined in Table 64-1.

Table 64-1 Glossary of Terms Used in Discussion of the Human Microbiome

 
 
Term Definition 
Culture-independent analysis A type of analysis that does not require culture of microbes. Information is extracted directly from environmental samples. 
Diversity The distribution of different kinds of organisms in a specific habitat or habitats. Alpha diversity is, broadly speaking, the number of kinds of organisms in a single sample; beta diversity describes how the types of organisms are partitioned among samples.  
Domains of life The three major branches of life on Earth: the Eukarya (including humans), the Bacteria, and the Archaea 
Gnotobiotics Rearing of animals under sterile (germ-free) conditions. Animals subsequently can be colonized at various stages of their life cycle with defined collections of microbes. 
Human microbiome In ecology, biome refers to a habitat and the organisms in it. In this sense, the human microbiome would be defined as the collection of microorganisms associated with the human body. However, the term microbiome is also used to refer to the collective genomes and genes present in members of a particular microbiota, and the human metagenome is the sum of the human genome and microbial genes (microbiome). A core human microbiome is defined as everything shared in a par-ticular body habitat among all or the vast majority of human microbiomes. A core microbiome may include a common set of genomes and genes encoding various protein families and/or metabolic capabilities. Microbial genes that are variably represented in different humans may contribute to distinctive physiologic/metabolic phenotypes.  
Metagenomics An emerging field encompassing culture-independent studies of the structures and functions of microbial communities and their interactions with the habitats they occupy. Metagenomics includes (1) shotgun sequencing of microbial DNA isolated directly from a particular environment and (2) high-throughput screening of expression libraries constructed from cloned community DNA to identify specific functions such as antibiotic resistance (functional metagenomics). DNA-level analyses provide the foundation for profiling of mRNAs and proteins produced by a microbiome (meta-transcriptomics and meta-proteomics) and for identification of a community's metabolic network (meta-metabolomics).  
Microbiota A microbial community, including Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya, and viruses, that occupies a specific habitat 
Pan-genome The group of genes found in genomes that make up a particular microbial phylotype, including core genes found in all genomes and dispensable genes found in a subset of genomes within the phylotype  
Phylogenetic analysis Characterization of the evolutionary relationships between organisms and their gene products 
Phylogenetic tree A "tree" in which organisms are shown according to their relationships to hypothetical common ancestors. When built from molecular sequences, the branch lengths are proportional to the amount of evolutionary change separating each ancestor-descendant pair. 
Phylotype A phylogenetic group of microbes, currently defined by a threshold percentage identity shared among their small subunit rRNA genes (e.g., 97% for a species-level phylotype) 
Rarefaction A procedure in which subsampling is used to assess whether all the diversity present in a specific sample or set of samples has been observed at a specific sampling depth and to extrapolate how much additional sampling would be needed to observe all the diversity 
Resilience A community's ability to return to its initial state after a perturbation 
 

 

Computing power and software tools are evolving rapidly to mine the vast amount of data generated by these sequencers. The coevolution of software development and ever-increasing data-set generation is not surprising. In systems ranging from artificial organisms to bacteria to metazoa, coevolution of predators and prey greatly accelerates the evolutionary rate. Dawkins and Krebs (1979) introduced the concept of an "arms race" in which the predator has a clear advantage in developing better means for consuming its prey and the prey has a clear advantage in developing better means to avoid being eaten. Adaptation to evade a population that is itself adapting proceeds at a far more rapid rate than does adaptation to an environment that can change but cannot evolve in an adaptive way. The same dynamics are apparent in software development: the "consumers" of software produce ever-larger data sets that break the software, in part because the availability of these resources prompts new strategies for exploitation (i.e., the design of experiments that could not have been conceived without the availability of the improved tools). This intimate association between tool users and tool developers is essential for rapid development in terms of what the software can accomplish and what experiments can be conceived and accomplished in HMPs. HMPs also reflect a more ecologic focus of microbiology on the properties and functions of microbial communities; that is, these projects go beyond the properties and functions that individual component species of these communities exhibit when studied in isolation〞i.e., outside their native environments.

The ability to characterize the structures and functions of whole microbial communities without culturing their component members has spawned a new field of science known as metagenomics (Table 64-1). Metagenomics involves the sequencing of DNA isolated directly from a microbial community residing in a particular environment; the resulting information permits the application of other systems-level techniques, such as profiling of mRNA and protein products expressed by a microbiome and characterization of a community's metabolic activities. The goal of metagenomics (these allied systemwide characterizations) and of HMPs in general is an understanding of the ecologic principles and the various factors that determine how microbial communities are assembled, are maintained, and operate. The results promise to provide a deeper understanding of how habitats and microbial communities coevolve and, in the case of humans, how these communities vary both compositionally and functionally over time at different anatomic sites within an individual and in different groups of people living in different cultural contexts as well as how these communities contribute to human physiologic status, physiologic variation, disease predisposition, and disease pathogenesis.

Furthermore, HMPs address one of the most fundamental questions in genetics: How does environment influence the structure and function of "human genes"? Over a lifetime, each human encounters a unique environment. Part of this personally experienced environment is incorporated into the body habitat每associated microbiota. In this sense, HMPs will expand the conceptualization of "human" genetic potential from a relatively fixed deterministic view in which individuals are seen as inheriting only a defined set of 20,000 genes from their parents to a view in which each human acquires a microbiome containing a varied assemblage of genes several orders of magnitude larger than the collected H. sapiens genes through a process influenced by family, lifestyle, and life experiences as well as by H. sapiens genes. International HMPs probably will help determine whether there is a dimension of human evolution that is occurring at the level of the human microbiota and microbiome and〞if so〞whether, how, and how fast this microbial evolution may be affecting human biology. Finally, these projects probably will raise a number of important questions about personal identity, how to define the origins of health disparities, and issues related to privacy and confidentiality.

A Toolbox for Culture-Independent Metagenomic Analyses of Microbial Communities

Most members of complex microbial communities cannot be cultured by conventional laboratory techniques. The vast microbial diversity that exists inside and on the human body cannot be characterized with culture-based approaches, in large part because the metabolic milieu fashioned by these communities in their native habitats cannot be duplicated in vitro at this time. Therefore, investigators have turned to culture-independent methods to identify which organisms are present in a microbiota and in what abundance. The gene widely used to identify microorganisms and classify their evolutionary relationships encodes the major RNA component of the small subunit (SSU) of ribosomes. The SSU rRNA gene has been highly conserved among all known life forms on Earth. This conservation allows SSU rRNA genes from different organisms to be aligned accurately so that regions of nucleotide sequence variation can be identified readily. Pairwise comparisons of SSU rRNA gene sequences from different microbes allow the construction of a phylogenetic tree that represents an evolutionary map; previously unknown organisms can then be assigned a location (coordinate) on that map. This approach, known as molecular phylogenetics, allows each organism to be characterized on the basis of its evolutionary distance from other organisms. Different phylogenetic types (phylotypes) can be viewed as branches on an evolutionary tree.

The most straightforward way to define which microbes are present in microbial communities associated with the human body is to amplify SSU rRNA genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers directed at regions with nucleotide sequences that are conserved among all bacteria (or archaea or eukaryota) and that flank more variable regions. These variable regions can be used to discriminate among different kinds of organisms belonging to each of the three domains of life. Because bacteria dominate human microbial communities, most efforts have been devoted to defining bacterial diversity in the microbiota.

The coevolution of high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing with new software tools has led to an SSU rRNA renaissance that allows simultaneous characterization of the diversity present in hundreds to thousands of microbial communities. Sequencing of a small fragment of the 1500-bp (base pair) bacterial 16S rRNA gene has been found to be sufficient for many types of analysis. For example, 250-base reads encompassing a variable region of the gene are suitable for taxonomic assignments and microbial community comparisons provided that the region is chosen carefully. Primer design for PCR of bacterial 16S rRNA genes is a critical factor: differential annealing with different primer pairs designed to amplify different variable regions can lead to over- or underrepresentation of specific taxonomic groups (taxa), and different regions within the gene can have somewhat different patterns of evolution. Therefore, caution must be exercised in comparisons of the relative abundance of taxa in samples characterized in different studies using different methods.

A key innovation has been multiplex sequencing with highly parallel DNA sequencers that can generate large numbers of sequences with read lengths of 200 nucleotides. Amplicons generated from each microbial-community DNA sample are tagged by incorporation of a unique oligonucleotide barcode into the primer. Amplicons that harbor these sample-specific barcodes can be pooled together so that multiple samples representing multiple communities can be sequenced simultaneously (Fig. 64-1).

Figure 64-1

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pipeline for culture-independent studies of a microbiota. (A) DNA is extracted directly from a sampled human body habitat每associated microbial community. The precise location of the community and relevant patient meta-data are collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify portions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene containing one or more variable regions. Primers with sample-specific, error-correcting barcodes are designed to recognize the more conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene that flank the targeted variable region(s). (B) Barcoded amplicons from multiple samples (communities 1每3) are pooled and sequenced in batches in a highly parallel next-generation DNA sequencer. (C) The resulting reads are processed. Barcodes denote which sample the sequence came from. After barcode sequences are removed in silico, reads are aligned and grouped according to a specified level of shared identity; e.g., sequences that share 97% nucleotide sequence identity are regarded as representing a species. Once reads are binned in this fashion, they are placed on a phylogenetic tree of all known bacteria to infer their phylogeny. (D) Communities can be compared to one another by either taxon-based methods, in which phylogeny is not considered and the number of shared taxa is simply scored, or phylogenetic methods, in which community similarity is considered in light of the evolutionary relationships of community members. The UniFrac metric is commonly used for phylogenetic-based comparisons. In the three stylized examples here, communities with varying degrees of similarity are shown. Each circle represents an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) which is colored according to its community of origin and placed on a master phylogenetic tree that includes all lineages from all communities. Branches (horizontal lines) are colored with each community that contains members from that branch. Examples (i), (ii), and (iii) vary in the amount of branch length shared between the OTUs from each community. In (i), there is no shared branch length, and the three communities have a similarity score of 0. In (ii), the communities are identical and are assigned a similarity score of 1. In (iii), there is an intermediate level of similarity. Communities represented in red and green share more branch length and thus have a higher similarity score than red versus blue or green versus blue. The amount of shared branch length in each pairwise community comparison provides a distance matrix. (E) The results of taxon- or phylogenetic-based distance matrices can be displayed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), in which each community is plotted spatially such that the largest component of variance is captured on the x axis (PC1) and the second largest component of variance is displayed on the y axis (PC2). In the example shown, the three communities in (iii) from panel D are compared. Note that for shotgun sequencing of whole-community DNA (microbiome analysis), reads are compared with genes present in the genomes of sequenced cultured microbes and/or with genes that have been annotated by hierarchical classification schemes in various databases, such as KEGG. Communities can then be compared according to the distribution of functional groups in their microbiomes (in a manner analogous to taxon-based methods for 16S rRNA-based comparisons) and the results plotted by PCoA.
 
 

One important choice in multiplex barcoded sequencing involves a trade-off between the number of samples that can be processed simultaneously and the number of sequences per sample, which in turn depends on the expected size of the differences between microbial communities. Differences in the microbiota between individuals or between communities occupying different body habitats in the same individual are large; therefore, relatively few (<1000) SSU rRNA reads are required for discrimination among communities. However, the identification of systematic differences in community ecology that correlate with physiologic or pathophysiologic status is confounded by this immense interpersonal variation. For example, 1000 sequences per sample means that species present at 1% abundance can be identified with reasonable confidence, although this level of coverage will fail to identify many of the rarer species-level phylotypes that may provide critical functions for using specific nutrients or for triggering immune responses that greatly affect other components of the microbiota.

The capacity to perform multiplex sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes with highly parallel sequencers creates a problem: traditional tools for aligning sequences and defining taxonomic groups by their sequence similarity [a process known as picking operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] and traditional methods for phylogenetic analyses cannot handle the vast data sets involved. Emerging tools for performing large-scale alignments and large-scale taxon-based and phylogenetic analyses are starting to resolve this issue.

Both taxon-based methods (analyses based only on the OTUs present regardless of their evolutionary relationships) and phylogenetic methods (compositional analyses considered in light of the evolutionary relationships of community members) can be useful. The advantages of taxon-based methods are that they reveal directly which taxa contribute to the similarities and differences among samples (communities) and do not rely on possibly inaccurate tree reconstructions. The advantages of phylogenetic methods are that, with the same input data, they use a more accurate picture of evolution to provide clearer results than do taxon-based methods. Unlike taxon-based methods, phylogenetic methods do not assume that all taxa are equally related to one another.

UniFrac, a commonly used phylogenetic method that compares the evolutionary history encompassed within different microbial communities, can be used to compare any two communities by noting the degree to which they share branch length on a master tree of microbial life: the more similar communities are to one another, the more branch length they will share (Fig. 64-1). A matrix of UniFrac-based measurements of distances between each pair of communities can be generated and the results graphed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), or other geometric techniques that project a high-dimensional data set down onto a small number of dimensions that can be visualized and analyzed conveniently. The resulting dimensions show, in descending order, orthogonal contributions to variation in the full data set (Fig. 64-1).

Another level of analysis entails estimation of the richness, or diversity, of a microbial community by plotting the number of different types of SSU rRNA sequences at a specific phylogenetic level (e.g., species, genus) that are identified in a sample as a function of the number of sequences collected. Diversity estimates typically are based on rarefaction procedures, which assess how many species (or genera, etc.) would have been observed in a given sample if only 100, 200, 300, or more sequences had been collected.

Assembling a Bacterial 16S rRNA-Based Atlas of the Human Body

At several levels, humans are very much alike: their H. sapiens genomes are >99% identical, and they have similar collections of human cells. However, microbial communities differ drastically both between people and between habitats within a single human body. The variation is greatest between body sites; for example, the difference between the microbial communities residing in a person's mouth and those residing in that person's gut is comparable to the difference between the communities found in soil and in seawater. Even within a body site, the differences between people are not subtle: both gut and hand communities can differ by 80每90% at the bacterial species level, although the degree of variation in the mouth appears to be somewhat less (see below). The poet John Donne said that "no man is an island"; from a microbial perspective, however, each person consists of not just one isolated island but a whole archipelago of distinct habitats that exchange microbes with one another and with the "outside" at some undetermined level.

As with other ecosystems, human body habitat每associated microbial communities vary over time, and an understanding of this variation is probably essential to a functional understanding of the human microbiota. For example, studies of forests would prove puzzling without an understanding of the succession of events during which plant communities change systematically over time from weedy species colonizing fields to large mature trees. One exciting area opened up by high-throughput sequencing is the potential for tracking multiple body locations in multiple individuals over time, with direct visualization of the flow of microbes among different body habitats and different individuals in the presence or absence of various perturbations, such as antibiotic administration.

International HMPs must address a number of issues during the cataloging of microbial communities that inhabit humans. How many people have to be sampled (breadth) and how extensively (depth) to get a true measure of the extent of microbial diversity in humans? Where and how can investigators consistently sample a defined region of body habitat? In sampling relatively inaccessible microbial communities deep in the interior of the body, how can the risk to the donor be minimized? Defining the spatial features of microbial community structure in the mouth and the skin poses a particularly daunting challenge; for example, there is evidence that each tooth in an individual has a distinctive microbiota and that brushing produces a dramatic, immediate reduction in diversity. How often and over what period should a human being be sampled? What are the effects of gender? What is the impact of a person's relationship to family members who may or may not be sharing living space? What demographic factors should be evaluated (e.g., rural versus urban)? What is the impact of culture, lifestyle, health status, medications, and H. sapiens genotype?

Ecologists, who study the macroscopic world of plants and animals, have shown that the composition of a community depends on the order of initial entry of the component species. The same thing is probably true in the microbial world. Studies of bacterial diversity in fecal samples obtained from young adult female mono- and dizygotic twin pairs and their mothers over time have revealed that (1) the communities with the greatest degree of similarity are those derived from the same individual, (2) the similarity in the gut bacterial communities of adult monozygotic twin pairs is not significantly different in degree from the similarity of those of dizygotic twin pairs, and (3) fecal communities are more similar within family members than between members of different families. These results emphasize that early environmental exposures are a critical determinant of adult-gut microbial ecology. In humans, initial exposures depend on the mode of delivery. Babies sampled within 20 min of birth have relatively undifferentiated microbial communities in the mouth, the skin, and the gut. For vaginally delivered babies, these communities resemble the specific microbial communities found in the mother's vagina; for babies delivered by cesarean section, the communities resemble the mother's skin communities. The infant-gut microbiota changes to resemble the adult-gut community over the first 3 years of life and may continue to change throughout life. The stages at which communities in other body habitats reach their highly differentiated adult forms have not been determined.

An initial integrated view of the spatial and temporal distribution of bacteria in the human body has been obtained from a survey of communities of microbiota occupying 27 sites in a few healthy unrelated men and women. The body habitats sampled (on a given day for 2 consecutive days on two occasions separated by 3 months) included the gut (feces), the oral cavity, the external auditory canals, the inside of the nares, and 18 distinct skin locations (Fig. 64-2). Across all body habitats, members of 22 bacterial phyla were detected, but the vast majority of sequences belonged to only four bacterial phyla: Actinobacteria (37%), Firmicutes (34%), Proteobacteria (12%), and Bacteroidetes (10%). UniFrac-based PCoA revealed strong primary clustering by body habitat; community composition was significantly less varied within than between habitats. Within habitats, the degree of variation was significantly less within individuals sampled over time than between individuals sampled on a specific day. Finally, after habitat and individual had been taken into account, the degree of variation was significantly less over 1 day than over 3 months. People's daily composite "whole-body" communities revealed perfect grouping by host and month, further emphasizing that the personal microbiota signature remains relatively stable over time.

Figure 64-2

 
 
 
Results of a 16S rRNA gene sequence每based study of bacterial diversity in 27 body habitats of nine unrelated healthy human adults. The relative proportions of major phylogenetic groups present in the various microbial communities are shown. Note that skin communities occupying comparable positions on the right and left sides of the body are similar. (Adapted from Costello et al.)
 
 

Several surveys have emphasized that the skin harbors communities with predictable, albeit complex, biogeographic features (Fig. 64-2). To determine whether these differences reflect differences in local environmental factors, the history of the exposure of a specific site to microbes, or both, reciprocal microbiota transplantation has been performed in which microbial communities from one region of the skin are depleted by treatment with germicidal agents and the region (plot) is inoculated with a "foreign" microbiota harvested from different regions of the skin or from different body habitats from the same person or another individual. Community assembly at the site of transplantation subsequently is tracked over time. Remarkably, assembly proceeds differently at different sites: forearm plots receiving a tongue microbiota remained more similar to tongue communities than to native forearm communities in terms of their composition and diversity. However, forehead plots inoculated with tongue bacteria evolved to become more similar to native forehead communities. Thus, it appears that environmental factors operating at the forehead plot, in addition to the history of exposure to tongue bacteria, shaped community assembly.

These results underscore the need to specify body habitat when conducting microbial surveillance studies designed to examine the flow of normal and pathogenic organisms into and out of different body sites in inpatients and their health care providers. They also tie together several emerging themes from studies of human-associated microbial communities. Notably, there is a high level of interpersonal variability in every body habitat studied to date. Intrapersonal variation in a specific body habitat is less marked, making longitudinal studies of microbial community ecology in a person before, during, or after a perturbation (e.g., dietary, pharmacologic) an attractive study option.

The resilience of human-associated microbial communities after perturbation has been addressed in several other contexts. One study showed that hand washing led to profound changes in the microbial community, greatly increasing diversity (presumably because of the preferential removal of high-abundance dominant phylotypes such as Propionibacterium). Within 6 h, the microbiota had rebounded to resemble the original hand communities. In adults, studies of a few individuals who took a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin showed that restoration of the fecal community after antibiotic administration took several months. Both the nature and the time course of restoration (reconfiguration) varied with the individual. Most previously present taxa returned, although in different proportions. The effects of antibiotics given during the first year of life on the assembly of the microbiota are ill defined. Are these effects transient or persistent? Is the diversity of the adult microbiota affected? Intriguingly, the "hygiene hypothesis" links the development of the human immune system to microbial exposures early in life. Increasing evidence indicates that fewer exposures and less conditioning are associated with an increased risk of allergic disorders such as asthma and various food sensitivities.

Bacterial 16S rRNA每based studies of the midvaginal microbiota in sexually active asymptomatic women have documented significant differences in community configurations among four self-reported ethnic groups (women of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian ancestry). Unlike most other body habitats surveyed, this ecosystem is dominated by a single genus, Lactobacillus. Four species of this genus together make up more than one-half the bacteria in most of these communities. Five community groups, designated I每V, have been defined. Four groups are dominated by L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensii, whereas the fifth group includes proportionally fewer members of this genus and more anaerobes. The representation of these community categories was very distinctive within each of the four ethnic groups and correlated with vaginal pH and Nugent scores (a biomarker for bacterial vaginosis). Identification of the factors that determine the assembly of these distinct communities within and between ethnic groups as well as their resistance to or resilience after various physiologic or pathologic perturbations will require extensive longitudinal studies within individuals, including assessment of the impact of menstrual cycle, age, pregnancy, vaginal infections, and antibiotic use.

Who Else Is There? Other Branches of the Tree of Life Represented in the Human Body

Surveys based on SSU rRNA sequencing have focused largely on bacteria, yet the census of "who's there" in human body habitat每associated communities ultimately must take into account the other two domains of life (Archaea and Eukarya) as well as viruses. The representation of the four major Archaea phyla (Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, and Korarchaeota) in human microbial communities and their contributions to community functions are largely ill defined, in part because of the difficulty in optimizing Archaea-directed primer design. Some archaeons are known to play key roles in community metabolism. For example, methane-producing archaeons (methanogens) make up as many as 10% of all anaerobes in the feces of some humans, yet archaeal diversity in the gut microbiota appears to be low, with Methanobrevibacter smithii being the dominant species. Gut methanogens improve the efficiency of dietary polysaccharide degradation and fermentation by preventing the buildup of hydrogen gas, an end product of fermentation. It is not a particularly rewarding job: the task of coupling H2 oxidation with CO2 reduction to produce methane (CH4) is one of the lowest-energy-yielding reactions known in biology.

Culture-independent surveys of eukaryotic diversity in body habitat每associated communities of microbiota have been very limited to date. Information about the representation of members of this domain of life has important implications for defining "normal"; for example, eukaryotic parasites are represented in millions of hosts living in various parts of the world and may be construed as a component of "normal" in these regions. Culture-independent analyses have relied on targeting eukaryotic SSU rRNA genes that encode 18S rRNA as well as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of fungal rRNA genes. Metagenomic studies of the fecal microbiota of a few healthy human adults indicate that the degree of eukaryotic diversity is lower than that of bacterial diversity, with prominent representation of members of the genus Blastocystis〞obligate anaerobes with a wide host range whose role as parasites or pathogens in the human gut ecosystem is not clear. The fecal microbiota of these healthy humans also harbored other fungal genera (Galactomyces, Paecilomyces, and Gloeotinia). As with bacteria, culture-independent and culture-based surveys provide very different pictures of community composition, with Candida species appearing dominant among cultivable fecal eukaryotes.

Viruses are the major predators on this microbe-dominated planet, determining which microbial strains survive. Most genetic diversity on Earth is viral: viruses move DNA from microbial host to microbial host, harboring host-derived genes as they evolve. The current view is that there are 10 virus-like particles (VLPs) per microbial cell in virtually all microbial communities. Sequencing of VLP DNA from purified feces from a group of monozygotic twins and their mothers disclosed that prophages and phages constitute the majority of the virome, with a majority of the phages belonging to the Podoviridae. One survey found that most viral diversity in the distal gut was novel (<20% of VLP sequencing reads exhibited homology to known viruses) and that VLP sequences represented <5% of all fecal microbiome sequences. Time-course studies of the fecal virome revealed that viral populations〞like bacterial populations〞are most similar within an individual; i.e., interpersonal variation is greater than intrapersonal variation. Unlike bacterial populations, in which community composition is more similar among family members than among unrelated individuals, interpersonal variations in VLP-associated viral populations are not appreciably less pronounced within than between families.

The Microbiome: Convergent Functions from Different Species Assemblages

Characterization of the microbiome by shotgun sequencing is important because, unlike SSU rRNA analysis, this method provides a direct readout of the genes that are available to perform particular functions in a specific community. The central issues are (1) to what degree variation in species-level assemblages occupying particular body habitats correlates with variation in community gene content and (2) whether groups of genes are represented in a particular body habitat每associated community in most or all individuals. The neutral theory of community assembly developed by macroecologists posits that most species in a community will have the same general niche (profession) or will adopt the broadest niche possible, endowing the community with functional redundancy. If applicable to the microbial world, neutral community assembly would predict a high level of variation in the types of microbial lineages that occupy a specific body habitat in different individuals (as defined by SSU rRNA sequencing), although the broad functions encoded in the microbiomes of these communities could be quite similar. In addition, chemical food webs are generated when the metabolic product(s) of one type of microbe become the substrate(s) for other microbes. These webs can be incredibly elaborate and can change as microbes adjust their patterns of gene expression and metabolism in response to alterations in nutrient availability. Thus, the sum of all activities of members of a microbial community can be viewed as an emergent rather than a fixed property (Chap. e19).

There are several key challenges in dealing with data obtained from shotgun sequencing of microbiomes. The first challenge is to attain a biomass sufficient for DNA recovery. Most human microbiome characterization has used fecal samples because they can be obtained readily in bulk quantities, 50% of the biomass of stool is microbial, and feces are an excellent proxy for depicting interpersonal differences in gut microbial ecology. At present, microbiome-level analyses typically are based on counts of reads assigned to specific taxa or functions. It is challenging to reconstruct metabolic pathways realistically for prediction of symbiotic, syntrophic, or antagonistic relationships among organisms. A number of databases are available for functional assignments; they employ various schemes for hierarchical classification. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these functional assignments are based on the very limited number of cultured organisms that have been subjected to direct experimental analyses.

Shotgun sequencing of the fecal microbiome has revealed that different microbial communities (species assemblages) converge on the same functional state. In other words, there is a group of microbial genes represented in the guts of unrelated as well as related individuals. This "core" microbiome is enriched in functions related to microbial survival in the gut (e.g., translation; nucleotide, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism) and in functions that benefit the host (nutrient and energy partitioning from the diet to microbes and host). Microbial genes whose proportional representation in gut communities varies among individuals and make up a "variable" microbiome. Pairwise comparisons have shown that family members have functionally more similar gut microbiomes than do unrelated individuals. Thus, intrafamilial transmission of a gut microbiome〞which probably contains >100-fold more genes than the human genome〞within a specific generation and across multiple generations could shape the biologic features of humans belonging to a kinship. This second dimension of human gene flow (the other occurring at the level of H. sapiens genes) could modulate/mediate risks for a variety of pathogenic states.

The generalizability of the observation that vastly different species assemblages converge on similar gene functional repertoires in human body每associated habitats will have profound implications for an understanding of microbial functions in these different environments and the way these functions shape "human" physiologic and metabolic phenotypes. Issues such as the level of intra- and interpersonal variation in the gene content of the microbiome in various body habitats, the sampling depth required to characterize these differences, and the role of the H. sapiens genotype in shaping the microbiome genotype will be critical for informing this understanding.

Early Examples of Associations between the Human Microbiota and Disease States

HMPs probably will expand the scientific view of what constitutes a pathogenic microbe. Pathogens currently are viewed as discrete phylotypes that are able to elicit disease in susceptible hosts; this attribution is, in the best circumstances, based on satisfying Koch's postulates. A more ecologic view is that pathogens do not function in isolation; rather, their invasions and/or emergence as well as their effects on the host reflect interactions with other members of a microbiota. An even more expansive view is that a number of co-occurring organisms can "conspire" to produce pathogenic effects in certain host and environmental contexts, forming a "pathologic community."

The relationships of microbiota and microbiome composition and their function to human diseases are being investigated in many HMPs. The rationale for hypotheses invoking a disease每microbiota/microbiome relationship in many cases emanates from gnotobiotic mouse models (i.e., mice raised in germ-free environments〞with no exposure to microbes〞and then colonized at specific stages of life with different microbial communities). Germ-free animals are compared with conventionally raised animals of similar genotype or with germ-free mice that have received a microbiota from a conventionally raised mouse donor with a defined phenotype. These comparisons have shown that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the maturation of the innate as well as the adaptive components of the immune system, that the microbiota is a key trigger in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in animals that harbor mutations in genes associated with disease risk in humans, and that surface components of certain members of the gut microbiota can specifically modify the activity of the immune system to mitigate or prevent IBD. The risk of development of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible mice is modified by the gut microbiota; this fact provides additional evidence for the role of this microbial community in the pathogenesis of certain types of autoimmune disorders.

Gnotobiotic mice provide an excellent system for controlling host genotype, microbial community composition, diet, and housing conditions. Microbial communities harvested from donor mice of defined genotypes and physiologic phenotypes can be used to determine the impact of these communities on formerly germ-free recipients as well as the effect of the recipient on the transplanted microbiota and its microbiome. In this respect, gnotobiotic mice provide an opportunity to combine comparative metagenomic studies of donor communities with functional assays of community properties. Studies of gnotobiotic mice also have revealed that the gut microbiota plays a role in regulating the efficiency of energy and nutrient harvest from the diet; it does so not only by processing otherwise indigestible components of the diet (e.g., polysaccharides) but also by regulating host genes that affect energy storage in adipocytes. The microbiota influences the rate of epithelial turnover in the gut (the rate is slower in germ-free animals), modulates the development of the elaborate microvasculature that underlies the epithelium (capillary network density is markedly reduced in adult germ-free animals but can be restored to normal levels within 2 weeks after gut microbiota transplantation), is a key determinant of whether radiation enteritis follows abdominal or whole-body irradiation (germ-free mice are resistant), and influences gut motility. The impact of the gut microbiota extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Heart weight, whether measured echocardiographically or as wet mass and normalized to tibial length or lean body weight, is reduced significantly in germ-free mice; this difference is eliminated within 2 weeks after colonization with a gut microbiota. The presence or absence of a gut microbiota influences certain aspects of behavior, including locomotor activity. This observation raises the question of whether in this coevolved relationship microbes have developed strategies for manipulating certain features of host behavior that are mutually beneficial. For example, it is intriguing that plasma levels of serotonin are several-fold higher in conventionally raised mice than in germ-free mice.

Initial metagenomic studies of relatively small numbers of humans have provided insights into bacterial communities associated with several diseases, offering, for example, new ways to classify bacterial vaginosis, identifying alterations in the cutaneous bacterial communities of patients with psoriatic lesions, demonstrating shifts in the representation of various bacterial taxa in IBD, and revealing differences in the composition of the microbiota and microbiome in obese versus lean individuals as well as before and after bariatric surgery. The challenge provided by such observations is not only to expand the level of sampling to different populations of individuals but also to determine whether these associations are causal or only side effects of other processes.

Ongoing studies are exploring the impact of the microbiota on nutritional status, the development of Clostridium difficile colitis and its risk of relapse, the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature newborns, the pathogenesis of diabetes, and various other metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes). These studies include assessment of the impact of the microbiota on drug metabolism. Comparisons of metabolites in the blood of germ-free and conventionally raised mice by nontargeted mass spectrometry have disclosed hundreds of compounds that are detectable in one but not the other type of animal and whose concentrations are affected markedly by the microbiota. These include compounds that are conjugated with sulfate, glycine, glucuronide, or other charged adducts that also modify xenobiotics, potentially altering the capacity of the host to metabolize these foreign molecules. Analogous events are being observed in humans. For example, metabolism of the analgesic acetaminophen to either sulfonated or glucuronidated forms is associated with predose levels of p-cresol, a microbial tyrosine metabolite that competes with acetaminophen for its sulfonate donor and the relevant sulfotransferase enzyme. Higher levels of p-cresol correlate with decreased sulfonation and increased glucuronidation of acetaminophen.

An additional series of metagenomic studies is exploring antibiotic resistance reservoirs in human microbial communities. To this end, a recent study of fecal samples used expression cloning: taking random fragments of the microbiome, placing them in expression vectors in a bacterial host, and screening for antibiotic resistance phenotypes. A related study demonstrated that bacteria subsisting on antibiotics are widely distributed in the environment. Capable of degrading a variety of antibiotics, these organisms are extensively drug resistant, phylogenetically diverse, and in many cases related to pathogens; they also harbor many resistance genes identical to those in clinical pathogens.

The role of microbes in therapeutics extends to clinical trials of the impact of probiotics〞most recovered from fermented dairy products〞on various forms of IBD [pouchitis that occurs in both ileoanal (pull-through) pouches and continent ileostomies or in recurrent C. difficile colitis]. A number of questions raised about probiotics typify the issues that surround studies of the role of the microbiota and microbiome in disease pathogenesis and therapeutics. Is there a consistent configuration of the microbiota definable in the study population that is associated with a particular disease state? The answer has diagnostic and mechanistic implications. How is the configuration affected by the intervention? Is there an identifiable reconfiguration? If so, how does it proceed? Are there many routes? Are the pathways related to the initial pretreatment state? If a reconfiguration does occur, is it sustained after cessation of treatment? How is host biology related to the configuration or reconfiguration? As with all studies involving human microbial ecology, the issue of what constitutes a suitable reference control is extremely important: the person himself or herself? family members? age- and sex-matched individuals living in the same locale with similar cultural traditions?

Impact of HMPs on Genetic Determinism, Personal Identity, Cultural Traditions, and Personalized Medicine

Sets of mono- and dizygotic twins and their family members will be an extremely valuable resource for initially teasing out relationships between environmental exposures, H. sapiens genotype, and human microbial ecology. Similarly, monozygotic twins discordant for certain disease states represent a powerful paradigm that enhances the ability to determine whether various diseases (e.g., asthma, IBD, metabolic disorders) can be linked to a person's microbiota and microbiome. It will be important to explore microbial ecology in groups of individuals living in developing countries that are undergoing rapid transformations in lifestyle and experiencing the emergence of a variety of Western diseases. Birth cohort studies (including studies of twins) that are initiated every 10 years in these countries may capture the impact of changes in lifestyle, including diet, on human microbial ecology.

Defining the human metagenome (the genes embedded in the H. sapiens genome plus the microbiome) will provide an entirely new level of refinement to the human description of self as well as a potential microbial legacy of personal lifestyle choices. Although this information may promote an appreciation of the origins of certain health disparities, care must be taken to avoid stigmatization of individuals or groups of individuals who have different cultural norms or express different behaviors. Metagenomics is a new field through which to view the influence of cultural traditions on lifestyles and choices that in turn affect human microbial ecology. Cultural anthropologists must examine the impact of this field on the ways in which study volunteers who live in various cultural settings view the natural world that envelops them and the ways this field and their cultural traditions interact to influence their perceptions of forces that affect their lives or their connections to one another within the context of a family or community. The union of metagenomics and cultural anthropology can help reveal how cultural traditions (e.g., the way infants are handled and cared for in early life) influence the flow of microbes between generations of humans, thus shaping the physiologic and genetic features of a kinship.

Finally, although microbiome-directed/related diagnostics and therapeutics would represent a new and different dimension of personalized medicine, sensitivity to the societal impact of this work is essential. This field is changing the human sense of personal identity, relationships with the world, and genetic determinism. Studies of human microbiomes promise to uncover new gene and protein families and probably will reveal novel biotransformations by microbial communities that could have commercial and therapeutic implications. Assessing the microbiome's capacity to metabolize orally administered drugs may be highly instructive for the pharmaceutical industry as it investigates new and more accurate ways to predict drug bioavailability and toxicity. The chemical entities that human microbial communities synthesize to support mutually beneficial relationships with the host may become new classes of drugs; the human genes that these chemical entities target (manipulate) may represent new targets for drug discovery. Microbial strains harvested from the microbiota of people living in various parts of the world with varied diets and lifestyles could expand the repertoire of probiotic strains, including strains that could be added to food to enhance its nutrient value. Microbes, microbial genes, and microbial products may serve as new and valuable biomarkers of physiologic status and distinctive biological properties. Thus, a microbial ecology scan may become a standard component of regular health examinations or a tool for forensic scientists. All these speculations raise questions about how microbial strains and whole microbial communities obtained from volunteers should be archived and distributed as well as about who owns these reagents and discoveries emanating from them.
 
Summary

HMPs are an important manifestation of progress in the genome sciences, a timely step in the quest to achieve a better understanding of the place of humans in the natural world, and a reflection of the evolving focus of twenty-first-century medicine on disease prevention, new definitions of health, new ways to determine the origins of individual biological differences, and new approaches to elucidate how changes in lifestyle and biosphere affect human biology.

Systems Biology in Health and Disease: Introduction

The field of human biology has progressed over the last three centuries, largely as a result of the reductionist approach to the scientific problems that challenge the discipline. Biologists study the experimental response of a variable of interest in a cell or organism while holding all other variables constant. In this way, it is possible to dissect the individual components of a biologic system and assume that a thorough understanding of a specific component (e.g., an enzyme or a transcription factor) will provide sufficient insight to explain the global behavior of that system (e.g., a metabolic pathway or a gene network, respectively). Biologic systems are, however, much more complex and manifest behaviors that frequently (if not invariably) cannot be predicted from knowledge of their component parts characterized in isolation. Growing recognition of this shortcoming of conventional biologic research has led to the development of a new discipline, systems biology, that is defined as the holistic study of living organisms or their cellular or molecular network components to predict precisely their response to perturbations. Concepts of systems biology can be applied readily to human disease and therapy and define the field of systems pathobiology, in which genetic or environmental perturbations produce disease and drug perturbations restore normal system behavior.

Systems biology evolved from the field of systems engineering, in which a linked collection of component parts constitute a network whose output the engineer wishes to predict. The simple example of an electronic circuit can be used to illustrate some basic systems engineering concepts. All the individual elements of the circuit〞resistors, capacitors, transistors〞have well-defined properties that can be characterized precisely. However, they can be linked (wired or configured) in a variety of ways, each of which yields a circuit whose response to voltage applied across it is different from the response of every other configuration. To predict the circuit's (i.e., system's) behavior, the engineer must study its response to perturbation (e.g., voltage applied across it) holistically rather than its individual components' responses to that perturbation. Viewed another way, the resulting behavior of the system is greater than (or different from) the simple sum of its parts, and systems engineering utilizes rigorous mathematical approaches to predict these complex, often nonlinear, responses. By analogy to biologic systems, one can reason that detailed knowledge of a single enzyme in a metabolic pathway or of a single transcription factor in a gene network will not provide sufficient detail to predict the output of that metabolic pathway or transcriptional network, respectively. Only a systems-based approach will suffice.

It has taken biologists a long time to appreciate the importance of systems approaches to biomedical problems. Reductionism has reigned supreme for many decades, largely because it is experimentally and analytically simpler than holism, and because it has provided insights into biologic mechanisms and disease pathogenesis, and has led to successful therapies. However, reductionism cannot solve all biomedical problems. For example, the so-called off-target effects of new drugs that frequently limit their approval likely reflect the failure of a drug to be studied in holistic context, i.e., the failure to explore all possible actions aside from the principal target action for which it was developed. Other approaches to understanding biology therefore are clearly needed. With the growing body of genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data sets in which dynamic changes in the expression of many genes and many metabolites are recorded after a perturbation and with the growth of rigorous mathematical approaches to analyzing those changes, the stage has been set for applying systems engineering principles to modern biology.

Physiologists historically have had more of a (bio)engineering perspective on the conduct of their studies and have been among the first systems biologists. Yet, with few exceptions, they, too, have focused on comparatively simple physiologic systems that are tractable using conventional reductionist approaches. Efforts at integrative modeling of human physiologic systems, as first attempted by Guyton for blood pressure regulation, represent one application of systems engineering to human biology. These dynamic physiologic models often focus on the acute response of a measurable physiologic parameter to a system perturbation, and do so from a classic analytic perspective in which all the conventional physiologic determinants of the output parameter are known and can be modeled quantitatively.

Until recently, molecular systems analysis has been limited owing to inadequate knowledge of the molecular determinants of a biologic system of interest. Although biochemists have approached metabolic pathways from a systems perspective for over 50 years, their efforts have been limited by the inadequacy of key information for each enzyme (KM, kcat, and concentration) and substrate (concentration) in the pathway. With increasingly rich molecular data sets available for systems-based analyses, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, biochemists are now poised to use systems biology approaches to explore biologic and pathobiologic phenomena.

Properties of Complex Biologic Systems

To understand how best to apply the principles of systems biology to human biomedicine, it is necessary to review briefly the building blocks of any biologic system and the determinants of system complexity. All systems can be analyzed by defining their static topology (architecture) and their dynamic (i.e., time-dependent) response to perturbation. In the discussion that follows, system properties are described that derive from the consequences of topology (form) for dynamic response (function). Any system of interacting elements can be represented schematically as a network in which the individual elements are depicted as nodes and their connections are depicted as links. The nature of the links among nodes reflects the degree of complexity of the system. Simple systems are those in which the nodes are linearly linked with occasional feedback or feedforward loops modulating system throughput in highly predictable ways. By contrast, complex systems are nodes that are linked in more complicated, nonlinear networks; the behavior of these systems by definition is inherently more difficult to predict owing to the nature of the interacting links, the dependence of the system's behavior on its initial conditions, and the inability to measure the overall state of the system at any specific time with great precision. Complex systems can be depicted as a network of lower-complexity interacting components or modules, each of which can be reduced further to simpler analyzable canonical motifs (such as feedback and feedforward loops, or negative and positive autoregulation); however, a central property of complex systems is that simplifying their structures by identifying and characterizing the simpler substructures does not yield a predictable understanding of a system's behavior. Thus, the functioning system is greater than (or different from) the sum of its individual, tractable parts.

Defined in this way, most biologic systems are complex systems whose behaviors are not readily predictable from simple reductionist principles. The nodes, for example, can be metabolites that are linked by the enzymes that cause their transformations, transcription factors that are linked by the genes whose expression they influence, or proteins in an interaction network that are linked by cofactors that facilitate interactions or by thermodynamic forces that facilitate their biochemical association. Biologic systems typically are organized as scale-free, rather than stochastic, networks of nodes. Scale-free systems are those in which a few nodes have many links to other nodes (highly linked nodes, or hubs) but most nodes have only a few links (weakly linked nodes). The term scale-free refers to the fact that the distribution of nodes in the network is not influenced by the magnitude or scale of the links considered. This is quite different from two other common network architectures: random (Poisson) and exponential distributions. Scale-free networks can be mathematically described by a power law that defines the probability of the number of links per node [P(k) = k每(t), where k is the number of links per node and is the slope of the log P(k) versus log(k) plot]; this unique property of most biologic networks is a reflection of their self-similarity or fractal nature (Fig. e19-1).

Figure e19-1

 
 
 
Network representations and their distributions. A random network is depicted on the left, and its Poisson distribution of the number of nodal connections (k) is shown in the graph below it. A scale-free network is depicted on the right, and its power law distribution of the number of nodal connections (k) is shown in the graph below it. Highly connected nodes (hubs) are lightly shaded.
 
 

There are unique properties of scale-free biologic systems that reflect their evolution and promote their adaptability and survival. Biologic networks likely evolved one node at a time in a process in which new nodes are more likely to link to a highly connected node than to a sparsely connected node. Furthermore, scale-free networks can become sparsely linked to one another, yielding more complex, modular scale-free topologies. This evolutionary growth of biologic networks has three important properties that affect system function and survival. First, this scale-free addition of new nodes promotes system redundancy, which minimizes the consequences of errors and accommodates adverse perturbations to the system robustly with minimal effects on critical functions (unless the highly connected nodes are the focus of the perturbation). Second, this resulting network redundancy provides a survival advantage to the system. In complex gene networks, for example, mutations or polymorphisms in weakly linked genes account for biodiversity and biologic variability without disrupting the critical functions of the system; only mutations in highly linked (essential) genes (hubs) can shut down the system and cause embryonic lethality. Third, scale-free biologic systems facilitate the flow of information (e.g., metabolite flux) across the system compared with randomly organized biologic systems; this so-called "small-world" property of the system (in which the clustered nature of the highly linked hubs defines a local neighborhood within the network that communicates through weaker, less frequent links to other clusters) minimizes the energy cost for the dynamic action of the system (e.g., minimizes the transition time between states in a metabolic network).

These basic organizing principles of complex biologic systems lead to three unique properties that require emphasis. First, biologic systems are robust, which means that they are quite stable in response to most changes in external conditions or internal modification. Second, a corollary to the property of robustness is that complex biologic systems are sloppy, which means that they are insensitive to changes in external conditions or internal modification except under certain uncommon conditions (i.e., when a hub is involved in the change). Third, complex biologic systems exhibit emergent properties, which means that they manifest behaviors that cannot be predicted from the reductionist principles used to characterize their component parts. Examples of emergent behavior in biologic systems include spontaneous, self-sustained oscillations in glycolysis; spiral and scroll waves of depolarization in cardiac tissue that cause reentrant arrhythmias; and self-organizing patterns in biochemical systems governed by diffusion and chemical reaction.

Applications of Systems Biology to Pathobiology

The principles of systems biology have been applied to complex pathologic processes with some early successes. The key to these applications is the identification of emergent properties of the system under study in order to define novel, otherwise unpredictable (i.e., from the reductionist perspective) methods for regulating the system's response. Systems biology approaches have been used to characterize epidemics and ways to control them, taking advantage of the scale-free properties of the network of infected individuals that constitute the epidemic. Through the use of a systems analysis of a neural protein-protein interaction network, unique disease-modifying proteins have been identified that are common to a wide range of cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders that cause inherited ataxias. Systems biology models have been used to dissect the dynamics of the inflammatory response using oscillatory changes in the transcription factor NF-kB as the system output. Systems biology principles also have been used to predict the development of an idiotypy每anti-idiotypy antibody network, describe the dynamics of species growth in microbial biofilms, and analyze the innate immune response. In each of these examples, a systems (patho)biology approach provided insights into the behavior of these complex systems that could not have been recognized with conventional scientific reductionism.

A unique application of systems biology to biomedicine is in the area of drug development. Conventional drug development involves identifying a potential target protein and then designing or screening compounds to identify those that inhibit the function of that target. This reductionist analysis has identified many potential drug targets and drugs, yet only when a drug is tested in animal models or humans are the systems consequences of the drug's action apparent; not uncommonly, so-called off-target effects may become apparent and be sufficiently adverse for researchers to cease development of the agent. A good example of this problem is the unexpected outcomes of the vitamin B每based regimens for lowering homocysteine levels. In these trials, plasma homocysteine levels were reduced effectively; however, there was no effect of this reduction on clinical vascular endpoints. One explanation for this outcome is that one of the B vitamins in the regimen, folate, has a panoply of effects on cell proliferation and metabolism that probably offset its homocysteine-lowering benefits, promoting progressive atherosclerotic plaque growth and its consequences for clinical events. In addition to these types of unexpected outcomes exerted through pathways that were not considered ab initio, conventional approaches to drug development typically do not take into consideration the possibility of emergent behaviors of the organism or the metabolic pathway or the transcriptional network of interest. Thus, a systems-based analysis of potential drugs (drug-target network analysis) can benefit the development paradigm both by enhancing the likelihood that a compound of interest will not manifest unforeseen adverse effects and by promoting novel analytic methods for identifying unique control points in metabolic or genetic networks that would benefit from drug-based modulation.

Systems Pathobiology and Human Disease Classification

Perhaps most important, systems pathobiology can be used to revise and refine the definition of human disease. The classification of human disease used in this and all medical textbooks derives from the correlation between pathologic analysis and clinical syndromes that began in the nineteenth century. Although this approach has been very successful, serving as the basis for the development of many effective therapies, it has major shortcomings. Those shortcomings include a lack of sensitivity in defining preclinical disease, a primary focus on overtly manifest disease, failure to recognize different and potentially differentiable causes of common late-stage pathophenotypes, and a limited ability to incorporate the growing body of molecular and genetic determinants of pathophenotype into the conventional classification scheme.

Two examples will illustrate the weakness of simple correlation analyses grounded in the reductionist principle of simplification (Occam's razor) in defining human disease. Sickle cell anemia, the "classic" Mendelian disorder, is caused by a Val6Gln substitution in the  chain of hemoglobin. If conventional genetic teaching holds, this single mutation should lead to a single phenotype in patients who harbor it (genotype-phenotype correlation). This assumption is, however, false, as patients with sickle cell disease manifest a variety of pathophenotypes, including hemolytic anemia, stroke, acute chest syndrome, boney infarction, and painful crisis, as well as an overtly normal phenotype. The reasons for these different phenotypic presentations include the presence of disease-modifying genes or gene products (e.g., hemoglobin F, hemoglobin C, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), exposure to adverse environmental factors (e.g., hypoxia, dehydration), and the genetic and environmental determinants of common intermediate pathophenotypes (i.e., variations in those generic pathologic mechanisms underlying all human disease〞inflammation, thrombosis/hemorrhage, fibrosis, cell proliferation, apoptosis/necrosis, immune response).

A second example of note is familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. This disorder is associated with 50 different mutations in three members of the transforming growth factor  (TGF-) superfamily: bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 (BMPR-2), activin receptor-like kinase-1 (Alk-1), and endoglin. All these different genotypes are associated with a common pathophenotype, and each leads to that pathophenotype by molecular mechanisms that range from haploinsufficiency to dominant negative effects. As only approximately one-fourth of individuals in families that harbor these mutations manifest the pathophenotype, other disease-modifying genes (e.g., the serotonin receptor 5-HT2B, the serotonin transporter 5-HTT), genomic and environmental determinants of common intermediate pathophenotypes, and environmental exposures [e.g., hypoxia, infective agents (HIV), anorexigens] probably account for the incomplete penetrance of the disorder.

On the basis of these and many other related examples, one can approach human disease from a systems pathobiology perspective in which each "disease" can be depicted as a network that includes the following modules: the primary disease-determining elements of the genome (or proteome, if posttranslationally modified), the disease-modifying elements of the genome or proteome, environmental determinants, and genomic and environmental determinants of the generic intermediate pathophenotypes. Figure e19-2 graphically depicts these genotype-phenotype relationships for the six common disease types with specific examples for each type. Figure e19-3 shows a network-based depiction of sickle cell disease using this kind of modular approach.

Goh and colleagues developed the concept of a human disease network (Fig. e19-4) in which they used a systems approach to characterize the disease-gene associations listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Their analysis showed that genes linked to similar disorders are more likely to have products that associate and greater similarity between their transcription profiles than do genes not associated with similar disorders. In addition, proteins associated with the same pathophenotype are significantly more likely to interact with one another than with other proteins not associated with the pathophenotype. Finally, these authors showed that the great majority of disease-associated genes are not highly connected genes (i.e., not hubs) and are typically weakly linked nodes within the functional periphery of the network in which they operate.

A. Human disease network. Each node corresponds to a specific disorder colored by class (22 classes, shown in the key to B). The size of each node is proportional to the number of genes contributing to the disorder. Edges between disorders in the same disorder class are colored with the same (lighter) color, and edges connecting different disorder classes are colored gray, with the thickness of the edge proportional to the number of genes shared by the disorders connected by it. B. Disease gene network. Each node is a single gene, and any two genes are connected if implicated in the same disorder. In this network map, the size of each node is proportional to the number of specific disorders in which the gene is implicated. (From Goh et al.

This type of analysis validates the potential importance of defining disease on the basis of its systems pathobiologic determinants. Clearly, doing this will require a more careful dissection of the molecular elements in the relevant pathways (i.e., more precise molecular pathophenotyping), less reliance on overt manifestations of disease for their classification, and an understanding of the dynamics (not just the static architecture) of the pathobiologic networks that underlie pathophenotypes defined in this way.

As yet another potential consideration, one can argue that disease reflects the later-stage consequences of the predilection of an organ system to manifest a particular intermediate pathophenotype in response to injury. This paradigm reflects a reverse causality view in which a disease is defined as a tendency to heightened inflammation, thrombosis, or fibrosis after an injurious perturbation. Where the process is manifest (i.e., the organ in which it occurs) is less important than that it occurs (with the exception of the organ-specific pathophysiologic consequences that may require acute attention). For example, from this perspective, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its consequences are a reflection of thrombosis (in the coronary artery), inflammation (in the acutely injured myocardium), and fibrosis (at the site or sites of cardiomyocyte death). In effect, the major therapies for AMI address these intermediate pathophenotypes (e.g., antithrombotics, statins) rather than any organ-specific disease-determining process. This paradigm would argue for a systems-based analysis that would first identify the intermediate pathophenotypes to which a person is predisposed, then determine how and when to intervene to attenuate that adverse predisposition, and finally limit the likelihood that a major organ-specific event will occur. Evidence for the validity of this approach is found in the work of Rzhetsky and colleagues, who reviewed 1.5 million patient records and 161 diseases and found that these disease phenotypes form a network of strong pairwise correlations. This result is consistent with the notion that underlying genetic predispositions to intermediate pathophenotypes form the predicate basis for conventionally defined end organ diseases.

Regardless of the specific nature of the systems pathobiologic approach used, these analyses will lead to a drastic revision of the way human disease is defined and treated. This will be a lengthy and complicated process but ultimately will lead to better disease prevention and therapy and probably do so from an increasingly personalized perspective. The analysis of pathobiology from a systems-based perspective is likely to help define specific subsets of patients more likely to respond to particular interventions based on shared disease mechanisms. This approach is being applied to certain conditions, for example, the responsiveness of lung cancer patients with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to erlotinib, an agent that targets EGFR. Although it is unlikely that the extreme of "individualized medicine" will ever be practical (or even desirable), complex diseases can be mechanistically subclassified and interventions may be tailored to those settings in which they are more likely to work.
